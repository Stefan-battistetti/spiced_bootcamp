<h1>Gapminder Life Expectancy Animation</h1>

**Project Goal: Create an animation of how global life expectancy has changed throughout the years**

<h2> Description</h2>

- Ploty Express was used to create an animation (available at html file) to illustrate the effects income has on life expectancy on a global scale.

- Each data bubble represents an individual country and they are colour coordinated to present their respective continent. The size of the data bubble represents the population of that particular country.
