-- What are the benefits of storing data in a database?
Reduced data redundancy
Reduced updating errors and increased consistency
Greater data integrity and independence from applications programs
Improved data access to users through use of host and query languages
Improved data security
Reduced data entry, storage, and retrieval costs
Facilitated development of new applications program

-- Enumerate a few use cases of a database in a data project.
Relational database
Non-relational (“NoSQL”) database
Key-value store
Full-text search engine
Message queue

-- What advantages does a query language like SQL have over Python?
SQL contains a much simpler and narrow set of commands compared to Python.
In SQL, queries almost exclusively use some combination of JOINS, aggregate functions, and subqueries functions.
SELECT productname, unitsonorder FROM products WHERE unitsonorder!=0;

-- What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases.
(Relational databases model data as records in rows and tables with logical links between them).
NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.

There are five practical differences between SQL and NoSQL:

Language
Scalability
Structure
Properties
Support and communities

-- Could you implement a linear model in PostGres? (predict, not train)
YES.
A regression line is simply a line y = ax + b that is able to compute an output variable y for an input variable x.

-- Could you implement a decision tree in PostGres? (predict, not train)
YES.
Hierarchical data could be treated as relational data model.

-- How old is PostGreSQL?
About 36 years
