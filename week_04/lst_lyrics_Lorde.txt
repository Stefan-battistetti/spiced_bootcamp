and i'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
no post code envy

baby really hurt me
crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please
but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands
play at romance, we slow dance
in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone
stroking her cheek

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
'til all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting
running through the night, but
every perfect summer's
eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own

we be thinking about what could have been
but we've had a record summer, can't turn it down, oh

smoke and sunset, off mulholland
he was talking, i was wondering 'bout
you and that girl, she your girlfriend?
face from heaven, bet the world she don't know
pretty girls don't know the things that i know
walk my way, i'll share the things that you want

uh-oh, dancin' past the point of no return
let go, we can free ourselves of all we've learned
i love this secret language that we're speaking
say it to me, let's embrace the point of no return

crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please
but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands
play at romance, we slow dance
in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone
stroking her cheek

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
'til all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting
running through the night, but
every perfect summer's
eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own

crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please
but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands
play at romance, we slow dance
in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone
stroking her cheek

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
'til all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting
running through the night, but
every perfect summer's
eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own

i light all the candles
got flowers for all my rooms
i care for myself the way i used to care about you
these days, we kiss and we keep busy

i'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
hands under your t-shirt

well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
use our eyes, throw our hands overboard

i am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
drink up your movements, still i can't get enough
i overthink your p-punctuation use
not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

a rush at the beginning
i get caught up, just for a minute
but lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
can you hear the violence?
megaphone to my chest

broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make 'em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make 'em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make 'em all dance to it

our thing progresses, i call and you come through
blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
but we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the louvre
down the back, but who cares, still the louvre

okay i know that you are not my type (still i fall)
i'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (but what about love?)
nothing wrong with it, supernatural
just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting

baby really hurt me
crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please
but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands
play at romance, we slow dance
in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone
stroking her cheek

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
'til all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting
running through the night, but
every perfect summer's
eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans

they're gonna watch me
disappear into the sun
you're all gonna watch me
disappear into the sun

please could you be tender and i will sit close to you
let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
guess this is the winter
our bodies are young and blue
i'm at jungle city, it's late and this song is for you

'cause i remember the rush, when forever was us
before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
well, i guess i should go
yeah, i guess i should go

hard feelings
these are what they call hard feelings of love
when the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
alone with the hard feelings of love
god, i wish i believed you when you told me this was my ho-o-ome

i light all the candles
got flowers for all my rooms
i care for myself the way i used to care about you
these days, we kiss and we keep busy
the waves come after midnight
i call from underwater
why even try to get right?
when you've outgrown a lover (oh-oh)
the whole world knows but you (oh-oh)
it's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

three years, loved you every single day, made me weak
it was real for me, yup, real for me
now i'll fake it every single day 'til i don't need fantasy, 'til i feel you leave
but i still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries
how you'd dance for me
i'll start letting go of little things 'til i'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah

"what is this tape?"
"this is my favorite tape"

bet you wanna rip my heart out
bet you wanna skip my calls now

gonna wanna tape my mouth shut

wait 'til you're announced
we've not yet lost all our graces
the hounds will stay in chains
look upon your greatness and she'll send the call out
send the call out

call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
a hundred jewels on throats
a hundred jewels between teeth
now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
the moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
dancin' around the lies we tell
dancin' around big eyes as well
even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

we live in cities you'll never see onscreen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know we're on each other's team

i'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
so there

so all the cups got broke
shards beneath our feet
but it wasn't my fault
and everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
cause what this palace wants is release

i’m a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
and the scars that mark my body, they’re silver and gold
my blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
it keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
i move through town, i’m quiet like a fire
and my necklace is of rope, i tie it and untie it

and our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits
so people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
i’m going in (ooh)

this is the start of how it all ever ends
they used to shout my name, now they whisper it
i’m speeding up and this is the
red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
we rip the start, the colors disappear
i never watch the stars there’s so much down here
so i just try to keep up with them
red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

i dream all year, but they’re not the same kinds
and the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

and now people talk to me i’m slipping out of reach now
people talk to me, and all their faces blur
but i got my fingers laced together and i made a little prison
and i’m locking up everyone that ever laid a finger on me
i’m going in (ooh)

i feel a strange every now and then
fall asleep reading science fiction
i wanna fly in your silver ship, but

don't hang around as the promise breaks

kiss the feet of a sarlatan

all the rest is predictable
trying your hardest to melt the snow
tie the knots to concentrate
keep on pulling that rope will break

we'll welcome the new age
covered in warrior paint
lights from the jungle till dusk sky
see now the stars burst
looks just like a blood orange

and i'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
no post code envy

but every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
we don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams
but everybody's like cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.
jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
we don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

and we'll never be royals
it don't run in our blood
that kind of lux just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz
let me be your ruler, you can call me queen bee
and baby i'll rule (i'll rule i'll rule i'll rule)
let me live that fantasy

my friends and i we've cracked the code
we count our dollars on the train to the party
and everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
we didn't come from money

but every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
we don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams

let me live that fantasy

(ooh ooh oh)
we're bigger than we ever dreamed, and i'm in love with being queen
(ooh ooh oh)
life is great without a care
we aren't caught up in your love affair

and we'll never be royals
it don't run in our blood

welcome to your life
there's no turning back
even while we sleep
we will find you

acting on your best behaviour
turn your back on mother nature
everybody wants to rule the world

it's my own design
it's my own remorse
help me to decide
help me make the most

of freedom and of pleasure
nothing ever lasts forever
everybody wants to rule the world

there's a room where the light won't find you
holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
when they do i'll be right behind you

so glad we've almost made it
so sad they had to fade it
everybody wants to rule the world
everybody wants to rule the world
everybody wants to rule the world

all my life
i've been fighting a war
i can't talk to you or your friends
it's not only you
my heart jumps around when i'm alluded to
this will not do

'cause i was raised up
to be admired to be noticed
but when you're withdrawn it's the closest thing
to assault when all eyes are on you
this will not do

oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh

i'm faking glory
lick my lips toss my hair
and send a smile over
and the stories brand new
but i can take it from here
i'll find my own bravado

it's a switch flipped
it's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
and i can tell you that when the lights come on i'll be ready for this

it's in your blood stream
a collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
it's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

i was frightened of every little thing
that i thought was out to get me down
to trip me up and laugh at me

but i learnt not to want
the quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
i want the applause the approval the things that make me go

oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh

bring your own lampshade
somewhere there's a party
here it's never ending
can't remember when it started
pass around the lampshade
there'll be plenty enough room in jail

if being wrong's a crime
i'm serving forever
if being strong's your kind
then i need help here with this feather

if being afraid is a crime
we hang side by side
at the swingin' party down the line

pound the prairie pavement
losing proposition
quitting school and going to work
and never going fishing
water all around,
i never learned how to swim now

if being wrong's a crime
i'm serving forever
if being strong's your kind

there's nothing i want but money and time
million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick
there's nothing more cruel
than only nine lives
a limit in spite
will do the trick trick trick trick

we can leave the house lead the party let the people know
go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go

there's nothing as fun as coming untied
and running with the kids in the park park park park
there's nothing that hurts like letting you go
tiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark

we can leave the house lead the party let the people know
go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go
it's not about just being out with all our people
'cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw

i'm in a clique but i want out
it's not the same as when i was punched
in the old days there was enough
the card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood
i was in but i want out
my mother's love is choking me
i'm sick of words that hang above my head
what about the kid? it's time the kid got free

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
you'll get punched for the love club
for the love club

i joined the club and it's all on
there are fights for being my best friend
and the girls get their claws out
there's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
take the pill make it too ill
the other day i forgot my old address
i'm sitting pretty on the throne
there's nothing more i want
except to be alone

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
you'll get punched for the love club
for the love club

your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
so drop your chin and take yourself back home
and roll out your maps and papers
find out your hiding places again
the only problem that i got with the club
is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
when you're a member go on your great adventure again
they will be waiting at the end

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
you'll get punched for the love club
for the love club

pretty soon i'll be getting on my first plane
i'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
but my head's filling fast with the wicked games, up in flames
how can i f*ck with the fun again, when i'm known

we gladiate but i guess we're really fighting ourselves
roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
wide awake in bed, words in my brain,

everything i say falls right back into everything

i'm not in the swing of things
but what i really mean is
not in the swing of things yet

riding around on the bikes, we’re still sane
i won’t be her, tripping over on stage
hey, it’s all cool
i still like hotels, but i think that'll change
still like hotels, and my newfound fame
hey, promise i can stay good

no post code envy

bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room

but everybody's like cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.
jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
we don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

and we'll never be royals

dancin' around the lies we tell
dancin' around big eyes as well
even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams

go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cars go

in the park park park park
there's nothing that's hurt
like letting you go
it's like a bird eyes
in the dark dark dark dark

the card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood
i was in but i want out

i'm sick of words that hang above my head
what about the kid? it's time the kid got free

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
go get punched for the love club
for the love club.

i joined the club and it's all on
there are fights for being my best friend
and the girls get their claws out
there's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
take the pill make it too real.
the other day i forgot my old address
i'm sitting pretty on the throne,
there's nothing more i want
except to be alone.

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
go get punched for the love club
for the love club.

your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
so drop your chin and take yourself back home
and roll out your maps and papers
find out your hiding places again

the only problem that i got with the club
is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
when you're a member go on your great adventure again
and we'll be waiting at the end.

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
go get punched for the love club

bring your own lampshade
somewhere there's a party
here it's never ending
can't remember when it started
pass around the lampshade
there'll be plenty enough room in jail

if being wrong's a crime
i'm serving forever
if being strong's your kind
then i need help here with this feather

if being afraid is a crime
we hang side by side
at the swingin' party down the line

pound the prairie pavement
losing proposition
quitting school and going to work
and never going fishing
water all around,
i never learned how to swim now

bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
we don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams
but everybody's like cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.
jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
we don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

and we'll never be royals
it don't run in our blood
that kind of lux just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz
let me be your ruler, you can call me queen bee
and baby i'll rule (i'll rule i'll rule i'll rule)
let me live that fantasy

we count our dollars on the train to the party

wait 'til you're announced
we've not yet lost all our graces
the hounds will stay in chains
look upon your greatness and she'll send the call out

call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
a hundred jewels on throats
a hundred jewels between teeth
now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
the moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
dancin' around the lies we tell
dancin' around big eyes as well
even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

we live in cities you'll never see onscreen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know we're on each other's team

i'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
so there

so all the cups got broke
shards beneath our feet

and everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
cause what this palace wants is release

welcome to your life
there's no turning back
even while we sleep

acting on your best behaviour
turn your back on mother nature

it's my own remorse
help me to decide
help me make the most

of freedom and of pleasure
nothing ever lasts forever
everybody wants to rule the world

there's a room where the light won't find you
holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
when they do i'll be right behind you

so glad we've almost made it
so sad they had to fade it
everybody wants to rule the world

i'm in a clique but i want out
it's not the same as when i was punched
in the old days there was enough
the card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood
i was in but i want out
my mother's love is choking me
i'm sick of words that hang above my head
what about the kid? it's time the kid got free

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
go get punched for the love club
for the love club.

i joined the club and it's all on
there are fights for being my best friend
and the girls get their claws out
there's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
take the pill make it too real.
the other day i forgot my old address
i'm sitting pretty on the throne,
there's nothing more i want
except to be alone.

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
go get punched for the love club
for the love club.

your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
so drop your chin and take yourself back home
and roll out your maps and papers
find out your hiding places again

the only problem that i got with the club
is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
when you're a member go on your great adventure again
and we'll be waiting at the end.

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
go get punched for the love club
for the love club.

getting pumped up from the little bright things i bought
but i know they'll never own me (yeah)

i'll be the beauty queen in tears
it's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
we're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

pretty soon i'll be getting on my first plane
i'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
but my head's filling up with the wicked games, up in flames
how can i f*ck with the fun again, when i'm known
and my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
everything's cool when we're all in line, for the throne
but i know it's not forever (yeah)

i'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
and the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
my blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
it keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
i move through town, i'm quiet like a fire
and my necklace is of opal, i tie it and untie it

and our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits
so people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
i'm going in (ooh)

this is the start of how it all ever ends
they used to shout my name, now they whisper it
i'm speeding up and this is the
red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
we rip the start, the colors disappear
i never watch the stars there's so much down here
so i just try to keep up with them
red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

i dream all year, but they're not the same kinds
and the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

and now people talk to me i'm slipping out of reach now
people talk to me, and all their faces blur
but i got my fingers laced together and i made a little prison
and i'm locking up everyone that ever laid a finger on me
i'm going in (ooh)

all my life
i've been fighting a war
i can't talk to you or your friends
it's not only you
my heart jumps around when i'm alluded to
this will not do

'cause i was raised up
to be admired to be noticed

it's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
and i can tell you that when the lights come on i'll be ready for this

it's in your blood stream
a collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
it's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

i was frightened of every little thing
that i thought was out to get me down
to trip me up and laugh at me

but i learnt not to want
the quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
i want the applause the approval the things that make me go

i'm in a clique but i want out
it's not the same as when i was punched
in the old days there was enough
the card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood
i was in but i want out
my mother's love is choking me
i'm sick of words that hang above my head
what about the kid? it's time the kid got free

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
you'll get punched for the love club
for the love club

i joined the club and it's all on
there are fights for being my best friend
and the girls get their claws out
there's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
take the pill make it too ill
the other day i forgot my old address
i'm sitting pretty on the throne
there's nothing more i want
except to be alone

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
you'll get punched for the love club
for the love club

your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
so drop your chin and take yourself back home
and roll out your maps and papers
find out your hiding places again
the only problem that i got with the club
is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
when you're a member go on your great adventure again
they will be waiting at the end

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
you'll get punched for the love club

there's a humming in the restless summer air

but in all chaos, there is calculation
dropping glasses just to hear them break
you've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)
took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
it's clear that someone's gotta go
we mean it, but i promise we're not mean

and the cry goes out (ha)
they lose their minds for us, and how it plays out (ha)
now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

(oh! oh!)
you could try and take us (oh-oh)
but we're the gladiators (oh! oh!)
everyone a rager (oh-oh)
but secretly they're saviors
glory and gore go hand in hand
that's why we're making headlines (oh! oh!)
you could try and take us (oh-oh)
but victory's contagious

delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)
god knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way)
chance is the only game i play with, baby

no-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
the sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
tired little laughs, gold lie promises,
we'll always win at this, i don't ever think about death
it's alright if you do, it's fine
we gladiate but i guess we're really fighting ourselves
roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
wide awake in bed, words in my brain,
"secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?"
let me in the ring, i'll show you what that big word means

(oh! oh!)
you could try and take us (oh-oh)

or you'll be there when i'm the next one's made
kiss the feet of a sarlatan
some imagine freedom
all the rest is predictable
trying your hardest to melt the snow
tie the knots to concentrate
keep on pulling that rope will break

we'll welcome the new age
covered in war paint
lights from the jungle till dusk sky
see now the stars burst
looks just like a blood orange
don't it just make you wanna cry

this whole life of hallucination
you're not alone in anything

i love this life that i have, the vine hangin' over the door
and the dog who comes when i call, but i wonder sometimes what i'm missin'

well, my hot blood's been burnin' for so many summers now
it's time to cool it down, wherever that leads

'cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses

maybe i'm just stoned at the nail salon
maybe i'm just stoned at the nail salon again

got a memory of waitin' in your bed wearin' only my earrings

respect only comes from the money or your blood

i'm nineteen and i'm on fire
but when we're dancing i'm alright
it's just another graceless night

are you lost enough?
have another drink, get lost in us
this is how we get notorious, oh
'cause i don't know
if they keep tellin' me where to go
i'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh

all of the things we're taking
'cause we are young and we're ashamed
send us to perfect places
all of our heroes fading
now i can't stand to be alone
let's go to perfect places

every night, i live and die
meet somebody, take 'em home
let's kiss and then take off our clothes
it's just another graceless night, 'cause

all of the things we're taking
'cause we are young and we're ashamed
send us to perfect places
all of our heroes fading
now i can't stand to be alone
let's go to perfect places

all the nights spent off our faces
trying to find these perfect places
what the f*ck are perfect places anyway?

today is my birthday, and i'm riding high
hair is dripping, hiding that i'm terrified
but this is summer, playing dumber than in fall
everything i say falls right back into everything

not in the swing of things yet

riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
i won't be her, tripping over on stage
hey, it's all cool
i still like hotels, but i think that'll change
still like hotels, and my newfound fame
hey, promise i can stay good
(everything feels right) i'm little, but i'm coming for the crown
i'm little, but i'm coming for you (chase paper, get it)
i'm little but i'm coming for the title, held by everyone who's up

all work and no play

all business all day
keeps me up a level
all work and no play
keeps me on the new shit, yeah

all work and no play

and and all of the shit that we harbour
make all of the kids in the choirs sing woo-hoo-hoo

crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please
but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands
play at romance, we slow dance
in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone
stroking her cheek

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
'til all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting
running through the night, but
every perfect summer's
eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability

you can't hide your tears in wealth
when your heart knows you hate yourself
it's all pain we felt
just the way that the card's been dealt

and we don't have anything to lose

in my eyes, in my ears, bring might
love is only figured once in life
tell the crowd, search the town
can we make it out right now
it's a full meltdown

try to break her spirit so it shouldn't be surprisin'
we're here with no fear and gave her uprising
gonna blend in with the bullies and the bureaucrats
arrows pierce like lightning, choppers sound like thunder clap
never will you stand, we gon' lay you down
dominant and dapper kids comin' in to take the town
try to restrain us, even though you trained us
we're better than you are, now we're gonna make you feed us

we're all lookin' for status
cristal sent over on gratis
can't pretend we're not plastic
when these poker faces take practice
who to trust? who to love?
who to run from? who to hug?
set fire to a government of thugs
respect only comes from the money or your blood

we're out of sight, shadows of light
they're closing in and i know where we're goin'
but i don't know who i'll be

in my eyes, in my ears, bring might
love is only figured once in life
tell the crowd, search the town
can we make it out right now
it's a full meltdown

(i can hear, and see a ghost)
was it meant to be?
(in my mind, i know)
'cause i can't see
(and if you keep acting up)
i can't see
(i'm your undertow)

i remember when your head caught flame
it kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
well you laughed, baby it's okay
it's buzz cut season anyway
(well you laughed, baby it's okay)

explosions on tv, and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool, where everything is good

we ride the bus with the knees pulled in
people should see how we're living
(we ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
shut my eyes to the song that plays
sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(shut my eyes to the song that plays)

the men up on the news, they try to tell us all that we will lose
but it's so easy in this blue, where everything is good

and i'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
favorite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
i live in a hologram with you
where all the things that we do for fun (and i'll breathe, and it goes)
play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
but i live in a hologram with you

cola with the burnt-out taste
i'm the one you tell your fears to
there'll never be enough of us

explosions on tv, and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool, where everything is good

and i'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)

baby really hurt me
crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please
but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands
play at romance, we slow dance
in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone
stroking her cheek

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
'til all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting
running through the night, but
every perfect summer's
eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability

they're gonna watch me
disappear into the sun
you're all gonna watch me

i do my makeup in somebody else's car
we order different drinks at the same bars
i know about what you did and i wanna scream the truth
she thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar

well, those great whites, they have big teeth
oh, they bite you
thought you said that you would always be in love
but you're not in love no more
did it frighten you
how we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
on the light up floor

but i hear sounds in my mind
brand new sounds in my mind
but honey, i'll be seein' you, ever, i go
but honey, i'll be seein' you down every road
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

'cause honey i'll come get my things, but i can't let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
oh, i wish i could get my things and just let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

sometimes i wake up in a different bedroom
i whisper things, the city sings them back to you

all those rumors, they have big teeth
oh, they bite you
thought you said that you would always be in love
but you're not in love no more
did it frighten you
how we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?

well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
use our eyes, throw our hands overboard

i am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
drink up your movements, still i can't get enough
i overthink your p-punctuation use
not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

a rush at the beginning
i get caught up, just for a minute
but lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
can you hear the violence?
megaphone to my chest

broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make 'em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make 'em all dance to it

our thing progresses, i call and you come through
blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
but we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the louvre
down the back, but who cares, still the louvre

okay i know that you are not my type (still i fall)
i'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (but what about love?)
nothing wrong with it, supernatural
just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting

a rush at the beginning
i get caught up, just for a minute

wearing spf 3000 for the ultraviolet rays
made it to the island on the last of the outbound planes
got a trunkful of simone and céline and of course my magazines

lust and paranoia reign supreme

baby really hurt me
crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up

but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands

you're a liability

i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for

'til all of the tricks don't work anymore

i'm tryna blow bubbles, but inside
can't seem to fix my mood
today it's as dark as my roots
if i, if i ever let them grow out (ah-ah)
now all of my oceans have riptides
can't seem to find what's wrong
the whole world is letting me down
don't you think the early 2000s seem so far away? (ay-ay-ay-ay)

ladies, begin your sun salutations
transcendental in your meditations (love and light)
you can burn sage, and i'll cleanse the crystals
we can get high, but only if the wind blows (blows just right)

i can't feel a thing
i keep looking at my mood ring
tell me how i'm feeling
floating away, floating away

i'm tryna get well from the inside
plants and celebrity news, all the vitamins i consume
let's fly somewhere eastern, they'll have what i need (they'll have what i need)
let's go

ladies, begin your sun salutations
pluto in scorpio generation (love and light)
you can burn sage, and i'll cleanse the crystals
we can get high, but only if the wind blows (blows just right, ri-ri-ri-right)

i can't feel a thing
i keep looking at my mood ring
tell me how i'm feeling
floating away, floating away
all the sad girls sing
we'll keep dancing 'til the mood rings
tell us how we're feeling
we're floating away, floating away

take me to some kinda
take me to some kinda

watch the sun set, look back on my life (take me to some kinda)

to the ones who came before us
all the golden ones who were lifted on a wing
we had no idea the dreams we had were far too big
far too big

and we will walk together
psychedelic garlands in our hair
through the halls of splendor where the apple trees all grew
you'll leave us dancing on the fallen fruit
the fallen fruit
the fallen fruit
the fallen fruit

from the nissan, to the phantom, to the plane
we'll disappear in the cover of the rain
took the great minds and the vapers
and a pocketful of seed
it's time for us to leave

and we will walk together
psychedelic garlands in our hair
but how can i love what i know i am gonna lose?
don't make me choose

(the fallen fruit)
(the fallen fruit)

it's a blue day
we could jump bulli
when i hit that water
when it holds me
i think about my father
doing the same thing
when he was a boy
when he was a boy

it's a blue day
we could go fishing
you'll catch the big one
sliding the knife under the skin
grateful for this offering
and all the living things
under the sun
under the sun

little brother
i think you're an angel
see your silver chain levitate
when you're kick-flipping
baby boy, you're super cool
i know you're scared
so was i
but all will be revealed in time (time, time)

oh look, the rays are in the bay now
can you hear the waves and the cicadas all around?
i can make anything real
brain so hot, it's a summer body
every day is blue and never cloudy
don't look down
i can make anything real

in the future
if i have a daughter
will she have my waist or my widow's peak?
my dreamer's disposition or my wicked streak?
will she split a tab with her lover, laugh at the stars
like her mother when she was a girl?
when she was a girl

now the cherry-black lipstick's gathering dust in a drawer
i don't need her anymore
'cause i got this power
just had to breathe out and tune in
just had to breathe out and tune in
i just had to breathe, and tune in
i just had to breathe, and tune in
just had to breathe

oh, was enlightenment found? no, but i'm trying
taking it one year at a time
oh-oh, can you hear the sound? it's shimmering higher
on the beach i'm building a pyre
(use the wood brought in by the tide)
i know you'll show me how, i'll know when it's time
to take off my robes and step into the choir

_____
remember when we used to sing, baby
up in your room, before your mother got home?
there was a sound to our innocence
our voices were lovers in the same bed
now i'm not sure how they would sound, isn't it sad?
now that the ocean's all waves and the diamonds are blood
there's a new girl on your song
i didn't know that i could be replaced
years ago, i tried to get a message to you
but i never heard back, i never heard back

where did we go wrong?
our haven was always in a song
but just when i go to close the gates
permanently, i realize that it isn't me

no, i don't keep a list, can't hold a grudge
don't you think that we both might've done some growing up?
well, i know that some shit was said and done
but it's such a different world now, i can't hate anyone
remember when we woke at dawn
saw the silver sun in your old citroen?
and remember when we took them on?
stoners on the run, how the west was won

remember when we used to swim, baby
no one around, take off all our clothes?
and in a clear cold, we were born again
i used to count down to your birthday
now i'm not sure if it's june or july, isn't that sad?

where did we go wrong?
our haven was always in a song
but just when i go to close the gates
permanently, i realize that it isn't me

no, i don't keep a list, can't hold a grudge (hold no grudge)

yeah, i know that some shit was said and done (said and done)
but it's such a different world now, i can't hate anyone
remember when we woke at dawn
saw the silver sun in your old citroen?
and remember when we took them on?
stoners on the run, how the west was won

acting my age, not my horoscope
guess that's growing up
now i'm sending you love
and wishing you well
wherever you are

once upon a time in hollywood when carole called my name
i stood up, the room exploded 
and i knew that's it, i'll never be the same
that's when the door swung open 
and a voice said, "we're glad you came"

now i've spent thousands on you darling
all the hotels and the jets
and i'd pay it all again 
to have your golden body back in my bed
but i don't miss the poison arrows
aimed directly at my head

goodbye to all the bottles, all the models
bye to the clouds in the skies that all hold no rain-
(don't want that california love)
(don't want that california love)
(don't want that california love)

once upon a time the canyon store was where my world began
all that mystery and beauty 
gleaned from desert flowers and gifted children
but it got hard to grow up with your cool hand around my neck

now in my hotel, we're sunbathing
my girlfriends, and my baby
but every time i smell tequila
the garden grows up in my mind again

goodbye to all the bottles, all the models
bye to the kids in the lines for the new supreme-
(don't want that california love)
(don't want that california love)
(don't want that california love)
(don't want that california love)

dancing with my girls, only having two drinks then leaving
it's a funny thing, thought you'd never gain self control
guess it's been a while since you last said sorry
crying in the dark at your best friends' parties
you've had enough, gotta turn the lights up, go home

couldn't wait to turn fifteen
then you blink and it's been ten years
growing up a little at a time then all at once
everybody wants the best for you
but you gotta want it for yourself
my love

you can take 'em if you want 'em, these are just
secrets from a girl, who's seen it all
secrets from a girl, who's seen it
secrets from a girl
secrets from a girl, who's seen it all
secrets from a girl (secrets from a girl)
secrets from a girl, who's seen it all

'member all the hurt you would feel when you weren't desired?
(doing anything for more touch)
'member what you thought was grief before you got the call?
baby girl, no one's gonna feel the pain for you
you're gonna love again, so just try staying open
and when the time comes, you'll fall
yeah, when the time comes, you'll fall

your dreams and inner visions, all your mystical ambitions
they won't let you down
do your best to trust all the rays of light
everybody wants the best for you
but you gotta want it for yourself
my love

couldn't wait to turn fifteen, then you just go
(whoosh)
secrets from a girl, who's seen it all
secrets from a girl, who's seen it all
secrets from a girl
secrets from a girl, who's seen it all
secrets from a girl (secrets from a girl)
secrets from a girl, who's seen it all

welcome to sadness
the temperature is unbearable until you face it
thank you for flying with strange airlines
i will be your tour guide today
your emotional baggage can be picked up at carousel number 2
please be careful so that it doesn't fall onto someone you love
when we've reached your final destination
i will leave you to it
you'll be fine
i'm just gonna show you in
and you can stay as long as you need 
to get familiar with the feeling
and then when you're ready, i'll be outside
and we can go look at the sunrise 
by euphoria mixed with existential vertigo?
cool

_____
i heard that you were doing yoga
with uma thurman's mother
just outside of woodstock
now you're watering all the flowers
you planted with your new girlfriend
outside on the rooftop

just another phase you're rushing on through
go all new age, outrunning your blues
fifty gleaming chances in a row
and i watch you flick them down like dominoes
must feel good being mr. start again

i know
know a girl who knows a
another girl who knows the woman that you hurt
it's strange to see you smoking marijuana
you used to do the most cocaine
of anyone i'd ever met

just another phase you're shooting on through
the whole world changes right around you
you get fifty gleaming chances in a row
and i watch you flick them down like dominoes
must feel good being mr. start again
yeah, it must feel good being mr. start again
don't get up
yeah, it must feel good being mr. start again

_____
everyone knows that you're too good for me, don't they?
i'm a cheater, i lie and i'm shy
but you like to say hello to total strangers
shivering pines and walls of color
i can't believe i used to stay inside

but every perfect summer's got to say goodnight
now i watch you run through the amber light
i used to love the party, now i'm not alright
drinking in the dark, take me home tonight

baby, you're a big star
you're a big star
want to take your picture

i toss up if it's worth it now, every time i get on a plane
i've got so much to tell you and not enough time to do it in

but every perfect summer's gotta take its flight
i'll still watch you run through the winter light
i used to love the party now i'm not alright
hope the honeybees make it home tonight

baby, you're a big star
you're a big star
want to take your picture
'til i die
'til i die
'til i die

_____
if i had to break it down
i'd say it's the way you love to dance
moving the furniture when my back is turned
a flick of the lights and the world falls away
and your office job, and your silver hair
but our shapes in the dark are the reason i've stayed for all these years

i thought i was a genius
but now i'm twenty two
and it's starting to feel like all i know how to do is
put on a suit and take it away
with my fistful of tunes that it's painful to play
fingernail worlds, like favorite seashells
they fill up my nights and then they float away

i've got hundreds of gowns, i've got paintings in frames
and a throat that fills with panic every festival day
dutifully falling apart for the princess of norway

but you with your doll's lashes, your infinite t-shirts
i should've known when your favorite record 
was the same as my father's, you'd take me down

i guess i'll always be this way
swallowed up by the words and halfway to space
but there by the fire, you offered your hand
and as i took it, i loved you, the boy with the plan

you felled me clean as a pine
the man with the axe
and the light in his eyes

we've been through so many hard times
i'm writing a love song
for you, baby

_____
wait 'til you're announced
we've not yet lost all our graces
the hounds will stay in chains
look upon your greatness and she'll send the call out
send the call out

call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
a hundred jewels on throats
a hundred jewels between teeth
now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
the moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
dancin' around the lies we tell
dancin' around big eyes as well
even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

we live in cities you'll never see onscreen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know we're on each other's team

i'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
so there

so all the cups got broke
shards beneath our feet
but it wasn't my fault
and everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
cause what this palace wants is release

we live in cities you'll never see onscreen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know we're on each other's team

i'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
so there
i'm kind of older than i was when i reveled without a care
so there

we live in cities you'll never see onscreen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know we're on each other's team

we're on each other's team
and you know we're on each other's team
we're on each other's team
and you know and you know and you know

wait 'til you're announced
we've not yet lost all our graces
the hounds will stay in chains
look upon your greatness and she'll send the call out
send the call out

call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
a hundred jewels on throats
a hundred jewels between teeth
now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
the moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
dancin' around the lies we tell
dancin' around big eyes as well
even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

we live in cities you'll never see onscreen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know we're on each other's team

i'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
so there

so all the cups got broke
shards beneath our feet
but it wasn't my fault
and everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
cause what this palace wants is release

bring your own lampshade
somewhere there's a party
here it's never ending
can't remember when it started
pass around the lampshade
there'll be plenty enough room in jail

if being wrong's a crime
i'm serving forever
if being strong's your kind
then i need help here with this feather

if being afraid is a crime
we hang side by side
at the swingin' party down the line

pound the prairie pavement
losing proposition
quitting school and going to work
and never going fishing
water all around,
i never learned how to swim now

(one, two)

baby really hurt me
crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please
but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands
play at romance, we slow dance
in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone
stroking her cheek

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
'til all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting
running through the night, but
every perfect summer's
eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

they're gonna watch me
disappear into the sun
you're all gonna watch me

(go back and tell it)

please could you be tender and i will sit close to you
let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
guess this is the winter
our bodies are young and blue
i'm at jungle city, it's late and this song is for you

'cause i remember the rush, when forever was us
before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
well, i guess i should go
yeah, i guess i should go

hard feelings
these are what they call hard feelings of love
when the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
alone with the hard feelings of love
god, i wish i believed you when you told me this was my ho-o-ome

i light all the candles
got flowers for all my rooms
i care for myself the way i used to care about you
these days, we kiss and we keep busy
the waves come after midnight
i call from underwater
why even try to get right?
when you've outgrown a lover (oh-oh)
the whole world knows but you (oh-oh)
it's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

hard feelings
these are what they call hard feelings of love
when the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
alone with the hard feelings of love
god, i wish i believed you when you told me this was my ho-o-ome

three years, loved you every single day, made me weak
it was real for me, yup, real for me
now i'll fake it every single day 'til i don't need fantasy, 'til i feel you leave
but i still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries
how you'd dance for me
i'll start letting go of little things 'til i'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah

"what is this tape?"
"this is my favorite tape"

bet you wanna rip my heart out
bet you wanna skip my calls now
well, guess what? i like that
'cause i'm gonna mess your life up
gonna wanna tape my mouth shut
look out, lovers

we're l-o-v-e-l-e-s-s
generation
l-o-v-e-l-e-s-s

all fuckin' with our lover's heads

i'll be your quiet afternoon crush
be your violent overnight rush
make you crazy over my touch

into continents and cars
all the stages and the stars
i turn all of it

because ours (are the moments i play in the dark)
we were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

we're never done with killing time
can i kill it with you?
'til the veins run red and blue
we come around here all the time
got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you

you pick me up and take me home again
head out the window again
we're hollow like the bottles that we drain
you drape your wrists over the steering wheel
pulses can drive from here
we might be hollow, but we're brave

(and i like you)
i love these roads where the houses don't change (and i like you)
where we can talk like there's something to say (and i like you)
i'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and i like you)
we move in the tree streets
i'd like it if you stayed

now we're wearing long sleeves
and the heating comes on
(you buy me orange juice)
we're getting good at this
dreams of clean teeth
i can tell that you're tired

there's a humming in the restless summer air
and we're slipping off the course that we prepared
but in all chaos, there is calculation
dropping glasses just to hear them break
you've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)
took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
it's clear that someone's gotta go
we mean it, but i promise we're not mean

and the cry goes out (ha)
they lose their minds for us, and how it plays out (ha)
now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

(oh! oh!)
you could try and take us (oh-oh)
but we're the gladiators (oh! oh!)
everyone a rager (oh-oh)
but secretly they're saviors
glory and gore go hand in hand
that's why we're making headlines (oh! oh!)
you could try and take us (oh-oh)
but victory's contagious

delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)
god knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way)
chance is the only game i play with, baby
we let our battles choose us

no-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
the sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
tired little laughs, gold lie promises,
we'll always win at this, i don't ever think about death
it's alright if you do, it's fine
we gladiate but i guess we're really fighting ourselves
roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
wide awake in bed, words in my brain,
"secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?"
let me in the ring, i'll show you what that big word means

(oh! oh!)
you could try and take us (oh-oh)

hey, promise i can stay good

baby really hurt me
crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please
but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands
play at romance, we slow dance
in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone
stroking her cheek

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
'til all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting
running through the night, but
every perfect summer's
eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability

feel the party to my bones

i hate the headlines and the weather

but when we're dancing i'm alright
it's just another graceless night

are you lost enough?
have another drink, get lost in us
this is how we get notorious, oh
'cause i don't know
if they keep tellin' me where to go
i'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh

all of the things we're taking
'cause we are young and we're ashamed
send us to perfect places
all of our heroes fading
now i can't stand to be alone
let's go to perfect places

every night, i live and die
meet somebody, take 'em home
let's kiss and then take off our clothes

well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
use our eyes, throw our hands overboard

i am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
drink up your movements, still i can't get enough
i overthink your p-punctuation use
not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

a rush at the beginning
i get caught up, just for a minute
but lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
can you hear the violence?
megaphone to my chest

broadcast the boom boom boom boom

blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
but we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the louvre
down the back, but who cares, still the louvre

okay i know that you are not my type (still i fall)
i'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (but what about love?)
nothing wrong with it, supernatural
just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting

dancin' around the lies we tell
dancin' around big eyes as well

livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams

i'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
so there

shards beneath our feet

(one, two)

baby really hurt me
crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please
but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands
play at romance, we slow dance
in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone
stroking her cheek

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
'til all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting
running through the night, but
every perfect summer's
eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

they're gonna watch me
disappear into the sun
you're all gonna watch me
disappear into the sun

_____
break the news, you're walking out
to be a good man for someone else
sorry, i was never good like you
stood on my chest and kept me down
hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
did my best to exist just for you

bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

i am my mother's child, i'll love you 'til my breathing stops
i'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
but in our darkest hours, i stumbled on a secret power
i'll find a way to be without you, babe

i still feel you, now and then
slow like pseudo-ephedrine
when you see me, will you say i've changed?
i ride the subway, read the signs
i let the seasons change my mind
i love it here since i've stopped needing you

bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

i am my mother's child, i'll love you 'til my breathing stops
i'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
but in our darkest hours, i stumbled on a secret power
i'll find a way to be without you, babe

(i am my mother's child, i'll love you 'til my breathing stops)

wait 'til you're announced
we've not yet lost all our graces
the hounds will stay in chains
look upon your greatness and she'll send the call out
send the call out

call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
a hundred jewels on throats
a hundred jewels between teeth
now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
the moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
dancin' around the lies we tell
dancin' around big eyes as well
even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

we live in cities you'll never see onscreen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know we're on each other's team

i'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
so there

so all the cups got broke
shards beneath our feet
but it wasn't my fault
and everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
cause what this palace wants is release

oh, they bite you
thought you said that you would always be in love
but you're not in love no more
did it frighten you
how we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
on the light up floor

brand new sounds in my mind

i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
oh, i wish i could get my things and just let go

in the old days there was enough
the card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood
i was in but i want out

i'm sick of words that hang above my head
what about the kid? it's time the kid got free

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
go get punched for the love club
for the love club.

i joined the club and it's all on
there are fights for being my best friend
and the girls get their claws out
there's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
take the pill make it too real.
the other day i forgot my old address
i'm sitting pretty on the throne,
there's nothing more i want
except to be alone.

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
go get punched for the love club
for the love club.

your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
so drop your chin and take yourself back home
and roll out your maps and papers
find out your hiding places again

the only problem that i got with the club

when you're a member go on your great adventure again
and we'll be waiting at the end.

i'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
and the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
my blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
it keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
i move through town, i'm quiet like a fire
and my necklace is of opal, i tie it and untie it

and our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits
so people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
i'm going in (ooh)

this is the start of how it all ever ends
they used to shout my name, now they whisper it
i'm speeding up and this is the
red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
we rip the start, the colors disappear
i never watch the stars there's so much down here
so i just try to keep up with them
red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

i dream all year, but they're not the same kinds
and the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

and now people talk to me i'm slipping out of reach now
people talk to me, and all their faces blur
but i got my fingers laced together and i made a little prison
and i'm locking up everyone that ever laid a finger on me
i'm going in (ooh)

and baby, i'll rule (i'll rule, i'll rule, i'll rule)
let me live that fantasy

hey, hey

you've heard it all before
one minute, i was killing 'em all
and the next, a brown suit wouldn't let me perform, ah
typical
so i took a happy face and it's coming on like a charm
i don't wanna get lost, i wanna worship the sun
if you want, you can come

i'm in my own little golden age
but it's such a pill when they don't appreciate

so when you smoke that cigarette
or when you talk shit 'bout an old friend
i know it's hard, but do your best
give yourself a break, have a little faith, ah
let's hear it for the girls
living in the modern world

they're banging on the door
everyone, please make way
for the girl who looks like she flew in from outer space
yesterday
i think i'll wait it out
my little thing is keeping 'em keen
they could be drinking with you, but they'll be looking at me
this whole time, i've been playing it coy
the city's falling for me just like i'm helen of troy, ah

so when you're broke, can't get ahead
or when you take it out on your boyfriend
i know it's hard, but do your best
give yourself a break, have a little faith
let's hear it for the girls
living in the modern world

give yourself a break, have a little faith
let's hear it for the girls
living in the modern world
let's hear it for the girls (let's hear it for the girls)
(living in the modern world) living in the modern world
