when you gimme those ocean eyes
i'm scared
i've never fallen from quite this high
falling into your ocean eyes

babe, when you hear the siren sounds
when the karma come back 'round, don't let me down
babe, there's a time to stand your ground
even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

eyesight is a gateway to a new day and the same hate
with a new height and the same feet on a airplane yellin' "mayday"
with a good girl gone bad girl who ain't gay 'cause her date rape
that's a metaphor for the us 'cause they got us all in the same state
state of mind, brain is minimized, put me on the news, only criticize
revolution will never be televised
for the enemy, they never empathize
and i never voted, never sugar coat it
with my finger itchin' and my gun loaded
when the fire open, let it be your moment
when i shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang!
this for trayvon and tree, burn the bush and chronic
speakin' honestly, we livin' in colonies, cnn sit-comedies
monstrosity run rampant all throughout united states
talkin' about let's make a fort, talkin' about let's make it great
if the shoes fit, tie it, grab the guns and riot
time to run with lions on the road to zion
in this age of violence, time to grab the iron
when i pop the silencer, it's nothing but silence when

babe, when you hear the siren sounds
when the karma come back 'round, don't let me down
babe, there's a time to stand your ground
even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

uh, look, okay
baby, i'm a fool because i thought you would stay
whether i win or i lose, they already think we dead
but they continue to shoot, i'm just gon' cover my head
i need to duck and not move (yeah), i bust a move when i (uh)
find a way to get on and get up, get out the crib
i was just looking into the mirror, tryna dislocate my fear
'cause you broke my heart, let me dry my tears
so serious, i'm so neglected
in the wrong direction with a long erection, got no protection
but it's, "f*ck the world"
when she bend it over, being over-sensitive
but did i mention that my real intentions are
really me dealin' with the consequences
and i see your tone is very condescending
when i talk to you, but no you won't admit it
and i pity the fool, been tryna to vent, but you ain't tryna hear it
like i'm not in here, but you gotta hear it
just how much you mean off to the side (oh, shit)
oh say can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street
bite the dust early like double sprite, and a r.i.p. tee
so proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blow in the night time
of the slum house, little drum bump of the 1,000
come-come here they come

babe, when you hear the siren sounds
when the karma come back 'round, don't let me down
babe, there's a time to stand your ground
even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

birds chirpin', dogs barkin', kids missin', milk cartons
soul dark as black markets, war is startin', more is sparkin'
historic prophets praise muhammad
diff'rent strokes, philip drummond
gave me crack, like i'm plumbin', jesus christ, second comin'
cut myself, now i'm numbin', never scared, never runnin'
chosen one, i'm one hunnid, pray for me, pray for london
guilty me, he ain't done and gun me down, all for nothin'
president in abundance, president is a puppet
gotta hate it, gotta love it, pass a class, i rise above it
wise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin' "f*ck it"
donald trump, donald duck, what the f*ck is the difference?
now we stuck, in a rut, this ain't what i envisioned
what is what? what is guts when you don't have intuition?
not a saint, not a sin, tell me what's my real religion?
genocide, genesis, they say it's a new beginnin'
i'm a sinner, you a sinner, i can see the devil grinnin', damn

if our grave was watered by the rain
would roses bloom?
could roses bloom?

they're playing our sound
laying us down tonight
and all of these clouds
crying us back to life
but you're cold as a knife

six feet under
i can't help but wonder
if our grave was watered by the rain
bloom
bloom
again

help, i lost myself again
but i remember you

help, i lost myself again
but i remember you
don't come back, it won't end well
but i wish you'd tell me too

our love is six feet under
i can't help but wonder
if our grave was watered by the rain
would roses bloom?
could roses bloom
again?

retrace my lips
erase your touch
it's all too much for me
blow away
like smoke in air
how can you die carelessly?

our love is six feet under
i can't help but wonder
if our grave was watered by the rain
would roses bloom?

they're playing our sound
laying us down tonight
and all of these clouds
crying us back to life
but you're cold as a knife

six feet under
i can't help but wonder
if our grave was watered by the rain
bloom

i like it when you take control
even if you know that you don't
own me, i'll let you play the role
i'll be your animal
my mommy likes to sing along with me
but she won't sing this song
if she reads all the lyrics
she'll pity the men i know

baby, i don't feel so good
six words you never understood
i'll never let you go
five words you'll never say (aw)
i laugh along like nothing's wrong
four days has never felt so long
if three's a crowd and two was us
one slipped away

i just wanna make you feel okay
but all you do is look the other way, mm
i can't tell you how much i wish i didn't wanna stay
i just kinda wish you were gay

is there a reason we're not through?
is there a twelve step just for you?
our conversation's all in blue
eleven, "heys" (hey, hey, hey, hey)
ten fingers tearin' out my hair
nine times you never made it there
i ate alone at seven, you were six minutes away (yay)

how am i supposed to make you feel okay
when all you do is walk the other way? uh
i can't tell you how much i wish i didn't wanna stay, uh
i just kinda wish you were gay

to spare my pride
to give your lack of interest an explanation
don't say i'm not your type
just say that i'm not your preferred sexual orientation
i'm so selfish
but you make me feel helpless, yeah
and i can't stand another day
stand another day

do you know me?
really know me?
you have opinions
about my opinions
about my music
about my clothes
about my body
some people hate what i wear
some people praise it
some people use it to shame others
some people use it to shame me
but i feel you watching
always
and nothing i do goes unseen
so while i feel your stares
your disapproval
or your sigh of relief
if i lived by them
i'd never be able to move
would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
would you like me to be quiet?
do my shoulders provoke you? does my chest?
am i my stomach? my hips?
the body i was born with
is it not what you wanted?
if i wear what is comfortable
i am not a woman
if i shed the layers
i'm a slut
though you've never seen my body
you still judge it
and judge me for it
why?
we make assumptions about people based on their size
we decide who they are
we decide what they're worth
if i wear more, if i wear less
who decides what that makes me, what that means?
is my value based only on your perception?
or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?

when i'm away from you
i'm happier than ever
wish i could explain it better
i wish it wasn't true
give me a day or two
to think of something clever
to write myself a letter
to tell me what to do

do you read my interviews?
or do you skip my avenue?
when you said you were passing through
was i even on your way?
i knew when i asked you to
be cool about what i was telling you
you'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
and i'd end up more afraid

don't say it isn't fair
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me miserable
so if you really wanna know

when i'm away from you
i'm happier than ever
wish i could explain it better
i wish it wasn't true

you call me again, drunk in your benz
driving home under the influence
you scared me to death but i'm wasting my breath
'cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends

i don't relate to you
i don't relate to you, no
'cause i'd never treat me this shitty
you made me hate this city

and i don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
and all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
so don't waste the time i don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
i could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but i'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
never paid any mind to my mother or friends
so i shut 'em all out for you 'cause i was a kid

you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone

at least i gave him something he can cry about
i thought about my future but i want it now

you couldn't save me but you can't let me go
i can crave you but you don't need to know

did i take it too far?
now i know what you are
you hit me so hard
i saw stars
think i took it too far
when i sold you my heart
how'd it get so dark?
i saw stars

lips meet teeth and tongue
my heart skips eight beats at once
if we were meant to be, we would have been by now
see what you wanna see, but all i see is him right now

i'll sit and watch your car burn
with the fire that you started in me
but you never came back to ask it out
go ahead and watch my heart burn
with the fire that you started in me
but i'll never let you back to put it out

your love feels so fake
and my demands aren't high to make
if i could get to sleep, i would have slept by now
your lies will never keep, i think you need to blow 'em out

i'll sit and watch your car burn
with the fire that you started in me
but you never came back to ask it out
go ahead and watch my heart burn
with the fire that you started in me
but i'll never let you back to put it out

when you call my name
do you think i'll come runnin'?
you never did the same
so good at givin' me nothin'
when you close your eyes, do you picture me?
when you fantasize, am i your fantasy?
now you know
now i'm free

i'll sit and watch your car burn
with the fire that you started in me
but you never came back to ask it out
watch my heart burn
with the fire that you started in me
but i'll never let you back to put it out

never let you back
let you burn, let you burn
never gonna let you back

something's in the

something's in the air right now
like i'm losin' track of time (time, time)
like i don't really care right now
but maybe that's fine
you weren't even there that day
i was waitin' on you (you)
i wondered if you were aware that day
was the last straw for me, and i know

i sent you flowers
did you even care?
you ran the shower
and left them by the stairs
ooh-ooh-ooh
ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy
oh-oh
thought you had your shit together

but damn, i was wrong (wrong)
you ain't nothin' but a lost cause (cause)
and this ain't nothin' like it once was (was)
i know you think you're such an outlaw, yeah
but you got no job (job)
you ain't nothin' but a lost cause (cause)
and this ain't nothin' like it once was (was)
i know you think you're such an outlaw
but you got no job

i used to think you were shy
but maybe you just had nothin' on your mind
maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
i used to wish you were mine
but that was way before i realized
someone like you would always be so easy to find

(so) so easy (easy)
(so mm-mm) easy, mm-mm-mm, mm

gave me no flowers
wish i didn't care
you'd be gone for hours
could be anywhere
i thought you would've grown eventually

but you proved me wrong (wrong)
you ain't nothin' but a lost cause (cause)
and this ain't nothin' like it once was (was)
i know you think you're such an outlaw (yeah)
but you got no job (no job)

try not to abuse your power
i know we didn't choose to change
you might not wanna lose your power
but having it's so strange

she said you were a hero, you played the part
but you ruined her in a year, don't act like it was hard
and you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
no wonder why you didn't ask
she was sleeping in your clothes (in your clothes)
but now she's got to get to class

how dare you?
and how could you?
will you only feel bad when they find out?
if you could take it all back, would you?

try not to abuse your power
i know we didn't choose to change
you might not wanna lose your power
but having it's so strange

i thought that i was special, you made me feel
like it was my fault you were the devil, lost your appeal
does it keep you in control? (in control)
for you to keep her in a cage?
and you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
you said you thought she was your age

how dare you?
and how could you?
will you only feel bad if it turns out 
that they kill your contract?
would you?

try not to abuse your power
i know we didn't choose to change
you might not wanna lose your power
but power isn't pain

mmm
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hmm

_____
told you not to worry
but maybe that's a lie
honey, what's your hurry? uh
won't you stay inside? oh
remember not to get too close to stars
they're never gonna give you love like ours

where did you go?
i should know, but it's cold
and i don't wanna be lonely
so show me the way home
i can't lose another life

hurry, i'm worried

the world's a little blurry
or maybe it's my eyes
the friends i've had to bury
they keep me up at night
said i couldn't love someone
'cause i might break
if you're gonna die, not by mistake

so, where did you go?
i should know, but it's cold
and i don't wanna be lonely
so tell me you'll come home
even if it's just a lie
bounce with me everybody, c'mon

i tried not to upset you
let you rescue me the day i met you
i just wanted to protect you
but now i'll never get to

hurry, i'm worried

where did you go?
i should know, but it's cold
and i don't wanna be lonely
was hoping you'd come home
i don't care if it's a lie

_____
i'm gettin' older, i think i'm agin' well
i wish someone had told me, i'd be doin' this by myself
there's reasons that i'm thankful, there's a lot i'm grateful for
but it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me 
more than anyone before (anyone before)
too bad they're usually deranged

last week, i realized i crave pity
when i retell a story, i make everything sound worse
can't shake the feeling that i'm just bad at healing
and maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
which is ironic, because when i wasn't honest
i was still bein' ignored (lyin' for attention just to get neglection)
now we're estranged

things i once enjoyed
just keep me employed now
things i'm longing for
someday, i'll be bored of
it's so weird
that we care so much until we don't

i'm gettin' older, i've got more on my shoulders
but i'm gettin' better at admitting when i'm wrong
i'm happier than ever, at least that's my endeavor
to keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'cause to be honest, i just wish that what i promise
would depend on what i'm given (not on his permission, wasn't my decision)
to be abused, mm

things i once enjoyed
just keep me employed now, mm
things i'm longing for, mm
someday, i'll be bored of
it's so weird
that we care so much until we don't

but next week, i hope i'm somewhere laughing
for anybody asking, i promise i'll be fine
i've had some trauma, did things i didn't wanna
was too afraid to tell ya, but now i think it's time

_____
wait a minute, let me finish
i know you don't care
but, can you listen?
i came committed, guess i overdid it
wore my heart out on a chain
around my neck, but now it's missin', mm

da-da-da-da-da-da
da-da-da-da-da-da-da
oh, mm

so i think i better go
i never really know how to please you
you're lookin' at me like i'm see-through
i guess i'm gonna go
i just never know how you feel
do you even feel anything?

da-da-da-da-da-da-da
da-da-da-da-da-da-da
ooh, mm

you said, "don't treat me badly"
but you said it so sadly
so i did the best i could
not thinkin' you would have left me gladly
i know you're not sorry
why should you be?
'cause who am i to be in love
when your love never is for me?
me

da-da-da-da-da-da-da
da-da-da-da-da-da-da
oh, mm

so i think i better go
i never really know how to please you
you're looking at me like i'm see-through
i guess i'm gonna go
i just never know how you feel
do you even feel anything?

babe, when you hear the siren sounds
when the karma come back 'round, don't let me down
babe, there's a time to stand your ground
even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

eyesight is a gateway to a new day and the same hate
with a new height and the same feet on a airplane yellin' "mayday"
with a good girl gone bad girl who ain't gay 'cause her date rape
that's a metaphor for the us 'cause they got us all in the same state
state of mind, brain is minimized, put me on the news, only criticize
revolution will never be televised
for the enemy, they never empathize
and i never voted, never sugar coat it
with my finger itchin' and my gun loaded
when the fire open, let it be your moment
when i shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang!
this for trayvon and tree, burn the bush and chronic
speakin' honestly, we livin' in colonies, cnn sit-comedies
monstrosity run rampant all throughout united states
talkin' about let's make a fort, talkin' about let's make it great
if the shoes fit, tie it, grab the guns and riot
time to run with lions on the road to zion
in this age of violence, time to grab the iron
when i pop the silencer, it's nothing but silence when

babe, when you hear the siren sounds
when the karma come back 'round, don't let me down
babe, there's a time to stand your ground
even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

uh, look, okay
baby, i'm a fool because i thought you would stay
whether i win or i lose, they already think we dead
but they continue to shoot, i'm just gon' cover my head
i need to duck and not move (yeah), i bust a move when i (uh)
find a way to get on and get up, get out the crib
i was just looking into the mirror, tryna dislocate my fear
'cause you broke my heart, let me dry my tears
so serious, i'm so neglected
in the wrong direction with a long erection, got no protection
but it's, "f*ck the world"
when she bend it over, being over-sensitive
but did i mention that my real intentions are
really me dealin' with the consequences
and i see your tone is very condescending
when i talk to you, but no you won't admit it
and i pity the fool, been tryna to vent, but you ain't tryna hear it
like i'm not in here, but you gotta hear it
just how much you mean off to the side (oh, shit)
oh say can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street
bite the dust early like double sprite, and a r.i.p. tee
so proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blow in the night time
of the slum house, little drum bump of the 1,000
come-come here they come

babe, when you hear the siren sounds
when the karma come back 'round, don't let me down
babe, there's a time to stand your ground
even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

birds chirpin', dogs barkin', kids missin', milk cartons
soul dark as black markets, war is startin', more is sparkin'
historic prophets praise muhammad
diff'rent strokes, philip drummond
gave me crack, like i'm plumbin', jesus christ, second comin'
cut myself, now i'm numbin', never scared, never runnin'
chosen one, i'm one hunnid, pray for me, pray for london
guilty me, he ain't done and gun me down, all for nothin'
president in abundance, president is a puppet
gotta hate it, gotta love it, pass a class, i rise above it
wise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin' "f*ck it"
donald trump, donald duck, what the f*ck is the difference?
now we stuck, in a rut, this ain't what i envisioned
what is what? what is guts when you don't have intuition?
not a saint, not a sin, tell me what's my real religion?
genocide, genesis, they say it's a new beginnin'
i'm a sinner, you a sinner, i can see the devil grinnin', damn

_____
bite my tongue, bide my time
wearing a warning sign
wait 'til the world is mine
visions i vandalize
cold in my kingdom size

one by one by one

blood on a marble wall

living or dying first
sleeping inside a hearse
i don't dream

i'd leave alone
just goes to show
that the blood you bleed

too much to bear

was i stupid to love you?
was i reckless to help?
was it obvious to everybody else

that i'd fallen for a lie?
you were never on my side
fool me once, fool me twice
are you death or paradise?
now you'll never see me cry
there's just no time to die

you call me again, drunk in your benz
driving home under the influence
you scared me to death but i'm wasting my breath
'cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends

i don't relate to you
i don't relate to you, no
'cause i'd never treat me this shitty
you made me hate this city

and i don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
and all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
so don't waste the time i don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
i could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but i'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
never paid any mind to my mother or friends
so i shut 'em all out for you 'cause i was a kid

you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone

my lucifer is lonely

standing there, killing time
can't commit to anything but a crime
peter's on vacation, an open invitation
animals, evidence
pearly gates look more like a picket fence
once you get inside 'em
got friends but can't invite them

hills burn in california
my turn to ignore ya
don't say i didn't warn ya

all the good girls go to hell
'cause even god herself has enemies
and once the water starts to rise
and heaven's out of sight
she'll want the devil on her team

my lucifer is lonely

look at you needing me
you know i'm not your friend without some greenery
walk in wearing fetters
peter should know better
your cover up is caving in
man is such a fool
why are we saving him?
poisoning themselves now
begging for our help, wow!

my lucifer is lonely

standing there, killing time
can't commit to anything but a crime
peter's on vacation, an open invitation
animals, evidence
pearly gates look more like a picket fence
once you get inside 'em
got friends but can't invite them

hills burn in california
my turn to ignore ya
don't say i didn't warn ya

all the good girls go to hell
'cause even god herself has enemies
and once the water starts to rise
and heaven's out of sight
she'll want the devil on her team

my lucifer is lonely

look at you needing me
you know i'm not your friend without some greenery
walk in wearing fetters
peter should know better
your cover up is caving in
man is such a fool
why are we saving him?
poisoning themselves now
begging for our help, wow!

told you not to worry
but maybe that's a lie
honey, what's your hurry?
won't you stay inside?
remember not to get too close to stars
they're never gonna give you love like ours

where did you go?
i should know, but it's cold
and i don't wanna be lonely
so show me the way home
i can't lose another life

hurry, i'm worried

the world's a little blurry
or maybe it's my eyes
the friends i've had to bury
they keep me up at night
said i couldn't love someone
'cause i might break
if you're gonna die, not by mistake

so, where did you go?
i should know, but it's cold
and i don't wanna be lonely
so tell me you'll come home
even if it's just a lie

i tried not to upset you
let you rescue me the day i met you
i just wanted to protect you
but now i'll never get to

hurry, i'm worried

where did you go?
i should know, but it's cold
and i don't wanna be lonely
was hoping you'd come home
i don't care if it's a lie
