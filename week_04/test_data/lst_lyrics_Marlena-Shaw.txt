it begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
i do pretty well, till after sundown,
suppertime i'm feelin' sad;
but it really gets bad,
'round midnight.

memories always start 'round midnight
haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
when my heart is still with you,
and ol' midnight knows it, too.
when a quarrel we had needs mending,
does it mean that our love is ending.
darlin' i need you, lately i find
you're out of my heart,

until they saw two lovers kissing

touch me in the morning
then just walk away
we don't have tomorrow
but we had yesterday

(hey!)
wasn't it me who said that
nothing good's gonna last forever?
and wasn't it me who said
let's just be glad for the time together?
it must've been hard to tell me
that you've given all you had to give
i can understand you're feeling that way
everybody's got their life to live

well, i can say goodbye in the cold morning light
but i can't watch love die in the warmth of the night
if i've got to be strong
don't you know i need to have tonight when you're gone?
'till you go i need to lie here and think about
the last time that you'll touch me in the morning
then just close the door
leave me as you found me, empty like before

(hey!)
wasn't it yesterday
we used to laugh at the wind behind us?
didn't we run away and hope
that time wouldn't try to find us (didn't we run)
didn't we take each other
to a place where no one's ever been?
yeah, i really need you near me tonight
'cause you'll never take me there again
let me watch you go
with the sun in my eyes
we've seen how love can grow
now we'll see how it dies

if i've got to be strong
don't you know i need to have tonight when you're gone?
'till you go i need to hold you until the time
your hands reach out and touch me in the morning
(mornings where blue and gold and we could feel one another living)
then just walk away
(we walked with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving)
we don't have tomorrow,
(there's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it)
but we had yesterday
(but yesterday's gone my love, there's only now and it's time to face it)
touch me in the morning...

time is all important to everything

when you're dealing with pain
love and the fact that you've lost it

when i met you, i was introduced to love and
after a period of time i came to be friends with pain
i've dealt with these emotions and i hope that i've come through
so if you don't mind

walk softly when you walk by me
'cause my heart is still, don't shake it up
now that i've cried my love to sleep
(cried my love to sleep)
don't wake it up, don't wake it up
(don't wake it up)

now that i've cried my love to sleep
(cried my love to sleep)
don't wake it up, don't wake it up
(don't wake it up, ooh)

if i seem distant and reserved when we meet
don't take the time to ask me, why
'cause it's bad enough that i've lost you
ohh, don't make it rough, ohh, just say hello and goodbye

tip toe when you pass by me
'cause my heart is still, don't shake it up
now that i've cried my love to sleep

don't wake it up, ooh, don't wake it up

remembering things i should forget
ooh, my love's a spark but it could burst into flames
'cause i'm not over you yet

walk softly when you walk by me

that time wouldn't try to find us (didn't we run)
didn't we take each other
to a place where no one's ever been?
yeah, i really need you near me tonight
'cause you'll never take me there again
let me watch you go
with the sun in my eyes
we've seen how love can grow
now we'll see how it dies

if i've got to be strong
don't you know i need to have tonight when you're gone?
'till you go i need to hold you until the time
your hands reach out and touch me in the morning
(mornings where blue and gold and we could feel one another living)
then just walk away
(we walked with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving)
we don't have tomorrow,
(there's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it)
but we had yesterday
(but yesterday's gone my love, there's only now and it's time to face it)
touch me in the morning...

is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
or is what i feel the real mccoy?

is it for all time or simply a lark?
is it granada i see or only asbury park?
is it a fancy not worth thinking of?
or is it at long last love?

where do you start? how do you separate the present from the past?
how do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? that didn't last
with bits of memories scattered here and there
i look around and don't know where to start

which books are yours?
which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
so many habits that we'll have to break
and yesterday's we'll have to take apart

one day there'll be a song or something in the air again
to catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
a moment in what might have been

where do you start? do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? i guess you try
and though i don't know where and don't know when
i'll find myself in love again
i promise there will always be a little place no one will see
a tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

it begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
i do pretty well, till after sundown,
suppertime i'm feelin' sad;
but it really gets bad,
'round midnight.

memories always start 'round midnight
haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
when my heart is still with you,
and ol' midnight knows it, too.
when a quarrel we had needs mending,
does it mean that our love is ending.
darlin' i need you, lately i find
you're out of my heart,
and i'm out of my mind.

let our hearts take wings'
'round midnight, midnight
let the angels sing,
for your returning.
till our love is safe and sound.
and old midnight comes around.
feelin' sad,
really gets bad
'round, 'round, 'round midnight

it's very clear, our love is here to stay
not for a year but ever and a day
the radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
may just be passing fancies and in time may go

together we're going a long, long way
in time the rockies may crumble, gibraltar may tumble
they're only made of clay
but our love is here to stay

when you're in my arms and i feel you so close to me

to save a world in despair
there'll come a time, when the world won't be singin'

who's willing to try to save a world
that's destined to die

little children today are really gonna suffer tomorrow
oh what a shame, such a bad way to live
all who is to blame, we can't stop livin'
live, live for life
but let live everybody
live life for the children
oh, for the children
you see, let's save the children
let's save all the children
save the babies, save the babies
if you wanna love, you got to save the babies
all of the children
but who really cares
who's willing to try
yes, to save a world
yea, save our sweet world

day in, day out
the same old hoodoo follows me about
the same old pounding in my heart whenever i think of you
and, darling, i think of you
day in and day out

day out, day in
i needn't tell you how my days begin
when i awake, i awaken with a tingle
one possibility in view
that possibility of maybe seeing you

come rain, come shine
i meet you and to me the day is fine
then i kiss your lips
and the pounding becomes
the ocean's roar
a thousand drums
can't you see it's love
can there be any doubt
when there it is
day in, day out

unforgettable
that's what you are
unforgettable

like a song of love that clings to me
how the thought of you does things to me
never before has someone been more
unforgettable in every way
and forever more, that's how you'll stay
that's why darling it's incredible
that someone so unforgettable
thinks that i am unforgettable too

like a nightingale without a song to sing

walking down a strange new street
hearing words that i have never heard
from a girl i've yet to meet

i'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
i'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
i haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
but i feel so gay in a melancholy way
that it might as well be spring

it might as well be spring

but if i could only work this life out my way
i'd rather spend it being close to you

but you're so far away
doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
it would be so fine to see your face at my door
and it doesn't  help to know you're so far away
so far away, yeah, you're so far away

traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
nothing else to do but close my mind
and i sure hope the road don't get to own me
there's so many dreams that i've yet to find

but you're so far away
doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
it would be so fine to see your face at my door
and it doesn't  help to know you're so far away
so far away, yeah, you're so far away

i just want to ask a question
who really cares?
to save a world in despair
there'll come a time, when the world won't be singin'
flowers won't grow, bells won't be ringin'
who really cares?
who's willing to try to save a world
that's destined to die
when i look at the world it fills me with sorrow
little children today are really gonna suffer tomorrow
oh what a shame, such a bad way to live
all who is to blame, we can't stop livin'
live, live for life
but let live everybody
live life for the children
oh, for the children
you see, let's save the children
let's save all the children
save the babies, save the babies
if you wanna love, you got to save the babies
all of the children
but who really cares
who's willing to try
yes, to save a world
yea, save our sweet world
save a world that is destined to die

touch me in the morning
then just walk away
we don't have tomorrow
but we had yesterday

(hey!)
wasn't it me who said that
nothing good's gonna last forever?
and wasn't it me who said
let's just be glad for the time together?
it must've been hard to tell me
that you've given all you had to give
i can understand you're feeling that way
everybody's got their life to live

well, i can say goodbye in the cold morning light
but i can't watch love die in the warmth of the night
if i've got to be strong
don't you know i need to have tonight when you're gone?
'till you go i need to lie here and think about
the last time that you'll touch me in the morning
then just close the door
leave me as you found me, empty like before

(hey!)
wasn't it yesterday
we used to laugh at the wind behind us?
didn't we run away and hope
that time wouldn't try to find us (didn't we run)
didn't we take each other
to a place where no one's ever been?
yeah, i really need you near me tonight
'cause you'll never take me there again
let me watch you go
with the sun in my eyes
we've seen how love can grow
now we'll see how it dies

if i've got to be strong
don't you know i need to have tonight when you're gone?
'till you go i need to hold you until the time
your hands reach out and touch me in the morning
(mornings where blue and gold and we could feel one another living)
then just walk away
(we walked with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving)
we don't have tomorrow,
(there's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it)
but we had yesterday
(but yesterday's gone my love, there's only now and it's time to face it)
touch me in the morning...

dream i ever knew.
down deep in my heart i hear it play.
i feel it start, then melt away.

i hear music when i touch your hand,
a beautiful melody
from some enchanted land.
down deep in my heart, i hear it say,
is this the day?

i alone have heard this lovely strain,
i alone have heard this glad refrain,
must it be forever inside of me,
why can't i let it go,
why can't i let you know,
why can't i let you know the song
my heart would sing?

that beautiful rhapsody
of love and youth and spring,
the music is sweet,
the words are true 
the song is you.

puts a brand new kind of thinkin' in your mind
and you can't go wrong 'cause you're groovin' all day long, aha

california soul
california soul, (soul)

they had the melody and the beat, yo
but it still didn't seem complete, yes
until they saw two lovers kissin', oh yeah
they knew just what was missin'
so happy they were rockin' and reelin
because they had added that lovin' feeling
to california soul
california soul (but get with it)

like a sound you hear that lingers in your ear, oh
you just can not forget it
from early in the morning 'til the sun goes down
it's in the air, it's in the air
oh, it's our friend

california soul

they say the sun comes up every morning, aah

the winds that ride on the high tide
whistles a melody
so the people started to sing
and that's how the surf gave birth i'm told
to california soul 
california soul (feels good)

in the eyes of the world i'm a loser just wastin' my time
i can't make a dime
in the eyes of the world being born was my first big mistake
i can't get a break
but in the eyes of my woman i stand
like a hero, a giant, a man who's as tall as can be
any fool can see

that she's lookin' through the eyes of love
lookin' through the eyes of love
lookin' through the eyes of love when she looks at me-ee.

in the eyes of the crowd i'm a do-nothin' kind of a guy
who'll just live and die
in the eyes of the crowd i'm another poor joe on the street
can't get on my feet
but in the eyes of my woman they're wrong
i'm a king and a lover as strong and as brave as can be
any fool can see

that she's lookin' through the eyes of love
lookin' through the eyes of love
lookin' through the eyes of love when she looks at me-ee.
she's making me believe someday
someday i'm gonna find a way
to be the man that she can see when she looks at me
lookin' through the eyes of love
lookin' through the eyes of love
lookin' through the eyes of love
lookin' through the eyes of love.
