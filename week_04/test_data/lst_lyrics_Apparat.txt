the street is rushing beneath
this is the fastest way i know
where all the cars move backwards
and giant alley trees were grown again

i cut across the city's backyards
counting cracks in the concrete
a burst open spider web
and every blade of grass will make me sneer

when all the fields dried up
tens of comfortable years ago
i made this journey once before
and the city fed me long enough

to put on weight around the middle
this is apparent affluence
lived in a pack when i was little
then i got pulled apart from closest friends

there was a door on my horizon
and silver sparkling rays were pouring in
so i sneaked away on soft hands
another world in the making

now i know how you felt

inside armies
they come to me
whispering of peace
in their digging
for cracks and holes
to hide
to hide
to hide
to hide

this moment, right
out of focus
left in space
where no one cares
and i, signaling myself
just to get through
for a second holds, and then it starts to slide
