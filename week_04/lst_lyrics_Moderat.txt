i walk in-between
what do i see
blank-eyed angel
staring through me

the room filled with stars
on astrology cards
porcelain figures
of what used to be

the ghosts that haunt
were in there with me
i walked to the edge
and all the fear left me

i went to the grass
searching to hide
the song's clear and
dazed from my mind

were in there with me
i walked to the edge
and all the fear left me

the ghosts that haunt
were in there with me

oh, i saw it
standing in a sigh
went through the grass
and there on the edge
all the fear left me

whoa, i saw it
standing in a sigh alone
i ran through the grass
and there on the edge
all the fear left me

i ran through the grass
and there on the edge
all the fear left me

i ran through the grass
jumped off the ledge
all the fear left me

why must i hide
in the forest of my mind?
i want to come out of the woods

they offer me shade
a face with no name
a game i can play
but i can't beat it

meditation, medication
i'm eating the hooks that tear me
meditation, medication
i'm eating the hooks that tear me

i'm walking back
through my living hell
to eat the hooks that tear
somehow i'm not scared of this

under my skin
lies the world feeding
the cure of my sin
the cure of my sin
the cure of my sin

went inside the caves of seven wolves
felt of the forces that lend themselves to speed
those final words to fracture the very structure
can't stand this glacial pace
the damage doneit seems these days are getting shorter
derails my train of thought what said in hand was done
chased unforgiveness down these corridors
locked down the basis for the willing form
a trail far from strayed
the damage done set aside from eyes of others
our frail structures can't keep up with the pace brought out for all to see
the damage done
face contradicting needswe bring our cages home
for none to see
in vain to lessen
responsibility
the damage done

in broken speech
you tricked me on shaky ground
don't tell me

it feels like walking on rusty nails
but the pain's not mine

where we collide
down is the only way out
'cause hell's above

i've tried to
focus on anything
but the strain inside

some words rush
oh, like jets in the sky

don't stay long
just passing by

but you talked it away

when i was dead asleep
behind
towering walls

they built a world outside
and i
missed the wake-up call

my stony breath crawled
to glory heavens be
there was a sea of sound
but it was silence 
that stole my sleep

when i was dead asleep
behind 
towering walls

they built a world outside
and i
missed the wake-up call

when i break cripple legs
through long winding streets
fill me with suffering
and the people
would see right through me

here it ends
no one’s gonna shed a tear
no need to shout
just to stand the silence

(a) well spent time
in the early morning’s haze
you sit and wait
watching full glasses through blank eyes

this is not
what you wanted
not
what you had in mind

vacuous winter stare
worn out version of yourself
to tough to fall
but not strong enough to turn

this is not

my spirit rises 
off the plate 
in front of me

to the space
where she waits

she speaks a language
distilled by time
to nothing more than

elbow and wink
let in the light
but obstruct my view
