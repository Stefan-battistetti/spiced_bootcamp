Ladies and gentlemen
The KitKat Club is proud to present
Something new, something different
So would you please give a warm welcome to 
The Rhythm

Well I came here for something funky to happen
Is this Christmas 'cause everybody's rappin
You better get sparked by the song that I sing
Although my name ain't Martin Luther
But I'm considered the king
Yo, my beats pumped by the mic I clamp
I don't need an amplifier
My brain is the amp
I got the beats that make you tingle
Make your body mingle
Like you got the fever for the flavor of a Pringle
Weak I say not so
I'm just like Picasso
A pioneer
I am here
Ask me how I got so fly
Any sense that I can give 'em
A New Beginning Stevie-o
And my dope rhythm
I sent the Lord master give a mental harm
My sole chief belief is that Islam
My beats pumped so let it grab ya
I got a trick but my name ain't Ali-Babba
So open Sessame
Neva heard the best of me
Betcha all the people intheplaceiswacknowlet'ssee
It's a New Beginning, my name Kwame
And if you didn't know I could tell you that I'm a
Mellow cool brotha
Slicker than oil
Rap get so hot it makes the spit boil
The Rhythm

Not the avarage rapper the K is more
Ryhmes like the thunderbolt of the mighty Thor
Pick a cell 'cause I can conquer boy
I break MCs like a Tonka Toy
Smooth suave savage yet debonair
Come in the party yeah I see you stop and stare
To hear the man to only have yo hand shook
You dress too cute to me you have the Jordache look
'cause I'm the mystical
Rap is polyphysical
Ask about Kwame 
Hey say he is a  musical fellow
He always mellow
He's neva highstung spunk
And when the mic is near him
It cleva I run smooth like Moet
Recite just like a poet
Ain't my slam oh man I know it
'Cause when I'm on the mic while boys say oh golly
Chick on my tip like a hip on poly grip
I go cameo be on the grammy show
I be sleek as a sheik out freak ganny ho
In the panty hose pumping close
Yo my rhymes slam well I suppose 'cause
I'm might neader um go washin that again
To write a fresh rhyme you know I can again
'Cause I destroy plus I'm like a hemmorid
Strong like a steroid avoid the Noid
The Rhythm

The black can take the M A X
And as I step in the party that's when they ask
For me to get on strong no fear like a Gladiator
Turn on steam up MC like a radiator
Play 'em all out executioner style
Speak my peace just release refusing to smile
This is serious though I rap a little humor
But still MC I hear assume I could neva
Bust a fat rap twice
And at that price 
On any mic you gave me I got nice
A push a pull up a sit up get up I'm fed up
Shut ya lip up and let's go head up
Poisionus as venom no mistakes in 'em
Gucci on silk you got Vasco in denim
No my name ain't taco Emilio or Paco 
But Kwame boy and I got yo 
Chick on the side 'cause she sweatin' my tip
Gave a peck on the neck just to wetten my lip
I don't drop my pants for those Raggedy Anns
Just to pass up a chance on a kids romance
I should have blown this mic 
Like I said I might
Got the force of 20 men like a Jedi knight
And 
It's kinda hard for me not to do it slow
So I gotta go
