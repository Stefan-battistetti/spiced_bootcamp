So many times have I asked you to tell me that I'm your girl.
'Cause time after time I have needed a reason just to get inside your world.
So many times have I asked you to ask me how it feels to love.
And when this love seems the only conclusion that I'm guilty of, oh, baby, then 
you put your lovin' arms around me and it feels like shelter.
And you put your lovin' arms around me and inside your arms I'm burning.
Put your lovin' arms around me.
And you whisper to me when you put your lovin' arms around me.
And inside this love I'm yearning.
 
Sometimes the way that you act makes me wonder what I am to you.
And sometimes I can't stand the way that I'm acting 
to be part of the things you do.
Often I've asked you for too much of your time; I'm stealing.
And when I dream of the fear that you're leaving, then I reach out.
My baby , then you put your lovin' arms around me and it feels like shelter.
And you put your lovin' arms around me and inside your arms I'm burning.
Put your lovin' arms around me.
And you whisper to me when you put your lovin' arms around me.
And inside this love I'm yearning.
 
Put your lovin arms around me and it feels like shelter.
And you put your lovin' arms around me and inside your arms I'm burning.
Put your lovin' arms around me.
And you whisper to me when you put your lovin' arms around me.
 
And inside this love I'm yearning, yearning, yearning.
Inside this love I'm burning, burning, burning.
Inside this love I'm yearning, yearning, yearning.
Inside this love I'm burning, burning, burning.
Inside this love I'm yearning, yearning, yearning.
Inside this love I'm burning, burning, burning.
Inside this love I'm yearning, yearning, yearning.
Inside this love I'm burning, burning, burning.
