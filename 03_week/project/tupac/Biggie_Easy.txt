Anything you want me to
I can't keep my hands off you
There's nothing I won't do

Ain't no matter how hard I try
I can't wave my tears goodbye
There's nothing I won't do

Oh baby I think of you; my heart is on the line
Oh baby I get with you; my mind feels so fine

There's nothing I won't do
Anything you want me to
I can't keep my hands off you
There's nothing I won't do

Can't keep my hands off you
Can't keep my hands off you
Can't keep my hands off you
There's nothing I won't do

Can't keep my hands off you
Can't keep my hands off you
Can't keep my hands off you
There's nothing I won't do
