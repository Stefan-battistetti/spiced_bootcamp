[Chorus: x2]
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowing ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound

I believe I got to see
We been making music since we were kids
Its all I want to do, for life
Keeping it real until the day I die
I stay funkish in my way
Continue to mash and don't forget to pray
I keep my hand on my steel
Because I love my life and I always will
Whatever people say to me
I take it in stride I'm thinking negro league
If you really don't know me
Then you best back up, I suggest strongly
They started this DPG
Until the day I D-I-E
For my L-I-F and E
No matter where I look that's all I see
And I know

[Chorus: x2]

Many niggas play to me
I think its because they see me on BET
'cause everybody knows my name
All the police think I'm serving game
Jealous niggas call us out
But I don't worry long as I hear their mouths
If ever they decide to kill
You better be prepared 'cause I know I will
I think I can guarantee
You don't want to be standing next to me
Before my final curtain call
My mistakes they really won't be long
If we bump this in the streets
Or even at some party
You niggas really can't see me
My request is that you stop trying
Before I let go

[Chorus: x2]

Everyday, the 45 stays I'm jacking forever
I busting taking now bowing down never
Gotta watch my back for these coppers
As well as the niggas that I kick it with
They stick you faster than these bitches will
Since I'm pimping everybody wants my riches
And I can't keep my god for buying weed acting every time
I smoke constantly and can't flinch me
From committing the murders so I chill and puff the herb
Who gots my back nobody
If little giant gaudy laying niggas down at the homey's party
Always be goin crazy I guess we are being who we are
Really say the nigga gotta be a star
I gots to get mine and if I'm blasting its my destiny
If I die then it was meant to be intentionally
Worry stressing no guessing your profession
When the murder take place set yourself a tech 9

[Chorus: x4]
