And in the end we shall achieve in time
The thing they call divine
And all the stars will shine for me
When all is well and well is all for all
Forever after
Living in the meantime wait and see

We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all we're just like you
We love the all of you

And when I cry for me I cry for you
With tears of holy joy
For all the days still to come
And did I ever say I'd never play
Or fly toward the sun
Living in the meantime something's gone

We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all we're just like you
We love the all of you

Well that sounds fine so I'll see you sometime
Give my love to the future of the humankind
Okay, okay, it's not okay
While it's on my mind there's a girl that fits the crime
For a future love dream that I'm still to find
But in the meantime

We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all we're just like you
We love the all of you

We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all we're just like you
We love the all of you

We love the all the all of you
Our lands are green and skies are blue

Just like you
Just like you
Just like, just like 
Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like, just like 
Just like you
