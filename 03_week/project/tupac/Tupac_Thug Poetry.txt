Yo yo 
I only ride for those that'll ride for me 
I only shoot for those that'll shoot for me 
I used to be in D.C. with my poetry 

Niggers said I'm on some other shit crazily 
I used to sell cracks from the front streets to back 
Then I got locked up wicked Jake popped up 
And the Jake he seen my style before 

But I'm stayin lyrical behind my door 
I'm in the yard God where niggas try to test me hard 
But my vocal's too powerful law, it's too potent 
I kick one verse, the whole cypher stood frozen 

Now them niggas want to parlay with me, general 
I'm smooth like them niggas that, don't blow trial 
I come on home to a new leaf, no beef 
Jose Luis yo I'm ill like an Indian chief 

And my dress code, ill like, indiglo 

[Chorus: x2]
Aiyyo we thugged out what, and we let y'all know 
we keep it thugged out, catch us at, every show 
Let's get the jump off jumped off, here's the bang out 
Yo at every fuckin club, yo we got octane out 

I need, nuttin but cash, I'm out in the stash 
Extra acres, Caribbean seeds with no crabs 
F*ck hunger, I'm gettin no younger, cop this half 
brick til my pocket just thick, sit back and laugh 

with the out of towners, keepin money around us 
Four pounders, flippin wiggies, to the sirens around us 
Cars and jewels, inside moves, three day cruise 
Booted from Beijing, ?brought? our ventures to ?use? 

The entrepreneur, droppin cock in your whore 
Keep pussy open like a nigga sniffin coke in the hall 
I do it all for y'all, basketball, or rims 
Fiberglass that hold guns when I play old friends 

Learn how to act around a playa who spike tracks 
Doublin the pressure if your Empire Strikes Back 
We savages.. break you up like marriages 
Stick you in public and hide the thrills in baby carriages 

[Chorus] 
 
The way I grace shit so swift, play it tenacious 
but smooth like a fugitive who move with a facelift 
I stay lit, passin Branson, finesse no less 
Reppin at random, forever at my best when I'm trancin 

niggas make me want to focus with emotion 
If you notice, the vultures I bring they sting so swift 
Your quotes is from Maze, my bang'll tip with any rapper 
these days, spittin venom when my wordplay sprays 

and claimin half this cash regardless, dome my target 
from the heart spittin my flow while slow niggas process 
Blow the spot rock aggressive, mac eleven shots in 
twenty seconds, flood money stashed kept in fed mint 

What is that monkey tail you trust with your math 
to lush your cash, rush in your path, bust you then dash 
That's why I'm never fast with the street shit 
Driftin in this deepness, with each step 

breath taken make you niggas speechless 
Distinctive, mad different's how I kick it 
Some niggas recognize I'm individualized when I spit it 

[Chorus]
 
What what what what what! 
Thugged out nigga 
Poet performin some other shit 
(I'm type priceless) 

On stage holdin my dick 
In front of all y'all bullshit ass niggas 
(We're ill niggas why'know) 
Probably jerk off or piss on the front row 

Throw that water on y'all, ya heard? (Word) 
We don't give a f*ck (aight) 
We gonna keep it on some thug shit 
From now to whenever nigga 

If it's on let us know it's on 
Try to sleep they'll sucka punch you 
F*ck that
