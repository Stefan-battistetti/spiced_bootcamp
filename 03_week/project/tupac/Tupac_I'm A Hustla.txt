Makaveli in this, Killuminati, all through your body
The blow's like a twelve gauge shotty
Feel me!
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me, eat my flesh, flesh and my flesh

Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you want to ride or die

I ain't a killer but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness int he rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggas coming for me, to my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention, rest in peace father
I'm a ghost in these killing fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go deep inside
The solitary mind of a madman who screams in the dark
Evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggaz is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
F*ck the world if they can't adjust
It's just as well, Hail Mary

Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you want to ride or die

Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you want to ride or die

Penitentiaries is packed with promise makes
Never realize the precious time the bitch niggas is wasting
Institutionalized I lived my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we balling
Catch me father please, cause I'm falling, in the liquor store
That's the Hennessey I hear ya calling, can I get some more?
Hail til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nothing to lose, just me and you
On a one way trip to prison, selling drugs
We all wrapped up in this living, life as Thugs
To my homeboys in Quentin Max, doing they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be down in the dark
Thuggin eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga

Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you want to ride or die

Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you want to ride or die

They got a APB, out on my Thug family
Since the Outlawz run these streets, like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off Hennessey and Thai
Tryin' it, mixed it, now I'm twisted blisted and high
Visions of me, Thug living getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs

Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
On the regular mashin' in a black Ac Integ-ra
Cock back, sixty seconds til the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preachin' church, I gave you love now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle til dawn
That's when sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggas get ya pay and weight up

If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hoping God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hoping God don't close the gate

Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you want to ride or die

Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you want to ride or die
