I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler homey
I got the product, narcotics for the customers homey
Feins open they be smoking like a muffler homey
niggas phony so I only got a couple of homies
If you a hustler I could, I could f*ck wit you homey
You spend a couple of bucks I stay in touch with you homey
I get money I get 20 to K I got 20 strips all doin' 20 a day
I get cake from buds and haze I'm making dubs
they hating 'cause I'm on the grind like I'm making love
when cops got the block hot like Jamaican clubs
cop weight, wait for a drought and then make it flood
try to take my cake you gon' take a slug
But you can take my information if you taking drugs
cause I can sell raid to a bug
I'm a hustler I can sell salt to a slug

I'm married to the game, same bride just a new groom
I do more then just do tunes
cause my bills come in too soon, my son gon' be two soon
royalty checks come like once in a blue moon
but I'm getting my doe for doing shows
I made more money on the grind then on the road
that's why I stay fly and flying on hoes
car's are so cool, Aston no shoes
just a rubber band on my wrist, no jewels
I ain't got to prove I'm rich, I'm no fool
I know the rules I ain't got time for it
But a nigga will shine when it's time for it
and they will hate you deal with the real cake
and they on the corner from morning to real late
I deal weight and if you bastards doubt me
I'm a hustler ask about, ask about me

[Chorus: x2]

I'm a hustler, I'm a I'm a hustler homey (Yeah)
I'm a hustler, I'm a I'm a hustler homey (Yeah)

Yeah they made you got saved don't be spend the change
In fifth grade I was hustling my Genesis game
I was dumb young selling chew gum to my classmates
on the cash chase moving at a fast pace
never been a dummy never did what the dummies do
so I had a mill to burn before I turned 22
more money, more problem is true
'cause the more money I make the more problem for you
yeah I used dude voice props to the boy Sean
he made it a hot line I made a hot song
So stop drawing man you got to respect it
I'm the best Swizz got it perfected don't mess with
C-A-double S-I-D-Y cause I became the best when B-I-G died
the kid do it big like P-U-N
'Cause I'm nice P-A-C with the P-E-N

[Chorus: x2]

I'm a hustler, I'm a I'm a hustler homey (Yeah)
I'm a hustler, I'm a I'm a hustler homey (Yeah)

All my niggas that ever had to hustle to get at a dollar, this for y'all man
Personality changed man,
The kid Cassidy, this for the hood man
