Tell me when to go [x4]
Go [Dumb x8]

Jesus Christ had dreads
So shake 'em
I ain't got none 
But I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight one
Ooh, tell me when to go
Talking on my ghettro on the way to the sto'
My 2nd or 3rd trip
Some Henny
Some Swishers 
And some Listerine Strips
Dr. Greenthumb lift
Just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops
But the homies you got to watch
The moon is full
Look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper 
Watching Oakland go wild
Ta-dow!
I don't bump mainstream
I knock underground
All that other shit 
Sugar-coated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting they lingo from

[Hook x2]
Tell me when to go [x4]
Go [Dumb x8]

I'm off that 18 purple juice
Like a man
Labeled the Black Zeus
King of the Super Duper (Hyphy x5)
And your wifey 
She don't (Like me x5)
From the Bay to the A
Put me in the back wood
Swisha sweet buds
Go to the sto'
Bitches wish I wrote 
I said they couldn't be saved by (John Doe x2)
I slid past on the gas 
Bitches looking at me
It's good x2
Like the granddaddy
Cross game
You get flipped like a burger patty
Or zig-zagged
Pass me a big old fatty
I drink white with a snow bunny
Talking big shit in the scraper
Goin hella dummy
1800
Jose Cuervo
Yaddadamean
Know I'm saying, though?

[Outro: E-40]

[x8] Now Scrape

[x2] Now, gas, brake, dip, dip
[x4] Shake them dreads
[x4] Let me see you show ya grill
[x4] Now Thizz-Face
[x4] Doors open, man.
[x4] Now... Watch em swang
[x2] Go stupid, Go [Dumb x2]
