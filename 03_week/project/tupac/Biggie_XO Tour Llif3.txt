And my money's right, yeah

Countin' them bands all way to the top 'til they be fallin' over
Countin' them bands on my way to the top 'til we fallin' over

I don't really care if you cry
On the real you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said baby I am not afraid to, die
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Like something you ride a sled down
I just want that head
My Brittany got mad
I'm really her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
One way that I trap now
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like "Come on over"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She said I'm insane yeah
I might blow my brain out
Xanny numb the pain yeah
Please, Xanny make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted but it keep controlling me
All that pain now I can't feel it, I swear that it's slowing me (yeah)

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said I am not afraid to, die
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

In the club they got no ones, that we were baked now
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes, you is not a G though
Look at you stackin' all your money, it ain't green though
I was counting that and it's not 20, that's a zero

She say
You're the worst, you're the worst
I cannot die because this my universe

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said baby I am not afraid to, die
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
