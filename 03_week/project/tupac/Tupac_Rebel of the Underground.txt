Rebel, rebel, rebel
Rebel, rebel

They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain
From a man like me, who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain, so with a little bass and treble
Hey Mister! It's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me, and the aftermath
I don't give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic, the maniac emcee
I give a shout out to your homies
And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G
On the streets or on TV
It just don't pay to be, a truth telling MC
They won't be happy till I'm banned
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
So point blank in your face, pump up the bass
And join the human race
I throw peace to the Bay
Cause from the Jungle to Oaktown, they backin' me up all the way
You know you gotta love the sound
It's from the rebel, the rebel of the underground

Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 

Now I'm face to face with the devils
Cause they breeding more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
And police brutality
Shit it put you in the nip and call it technicality
So you reap what you sow
So reap the wrath of the rebel, jacking em up once mo'
Now the fox is in the hen house, creeping up on your daughter
While you sleep I got her sneaking out
Tupac ain't nothing nice
I'll be nothing how I wanna, and doing what I'm gonna
Now I'm up to no good
The mastermind of mischief moving more than most could
So sit and slip into the sound
Peep the rebel, the rebel of the underground

Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 

They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down
I guess they scared of the rebel, the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record bout the punks trying to sweat me
In fact, they trying to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
Cause they don't like what I'm talking bout
So what's wrong with the media today?
Got brothers selling out cause they greedy to get paid
But me, I'm coming from the soul
And if it don't go gold, my story still getting told
And that way they can't stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
It's sloppy, don't even try to
I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through
So yo to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gang bang
They talking street slang, but the punks still can't hang
They making records bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some selling out, just to get your record out
But 2Pacalpyse is straight down
So feel the wrath of the rebel. the rebel of the underground

Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 

Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground
