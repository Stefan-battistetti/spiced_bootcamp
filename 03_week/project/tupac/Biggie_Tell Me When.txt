I got all this love, waiting just for you 
I just got to know, that your love is true 
Can't keep running boy, in and out my life 
want to be your girl, not cause the mood is right 

If i let you come inside 
Tomorrow will you hide? 
Will you be there for me? 
When i need someone to hold 

Baby don't misunderstand 
I do want you for my man 
I just need a little time 
Before i invest my love 

Don't walk away boy 
My love won't hurt you 
Don't walk away boy, 
I'll be right there for you 

You say all the things 
That i like to hear 
You push all my buttons baby 
Love to have you close to me 
want to feel your love 
want to be for sure

Each and every night 

If I let you come inside 
Tomorrow will you hide? 
Will you be there for me? 
When I need someone to hold 

Baby don't misunderstand 
I do want you for my man 
I just need a little time 
Before i invest my love 

Don't walk away boy
