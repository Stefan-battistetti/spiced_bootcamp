I luh you, mwah, haha!
Uh, yeah, yo

Lot of square feet chopping speed is the minimum
Talk all subliminal in love with a criminal
It's all coming back to the pot, no chemicals
She can get hired on the spot, no interviews
No carbs, just vitamins, minerals
Riding shotgun in the coupe with the general
You go hard for the kid, so I'm into you
Yeah, hold you down, that's what I'm finna do

No girls'll ride like you do for me, baby
That's why I hold you down, that's why I hold you down
Them girls on the side ain't got what I need, baby
That's why I hold you down, that's why I hold you down

Yo, cash come in rapidly, chicks coming after me
Here 'cause I wanna be, not 'cause I have to be
You the one I wanna be with, ma actually
I knew you were special 'cause we hit it off naturally
Had your guards up at first, now you attached to me
Gotta give you all of me, can't give you half of me
Could take your time girl, we gon' move carefully
The hot bath water, the meals you prepare for me
When nobody else was, you were always there for me
And I love myself, just need you to care for me
You done more than enough, I owe you now
So it's only right that I hold you down, woah

No girls'll ride like you do for me, baby (like you do for me)
That's why I hold you down, that's why I hold you down
Them girls on the side ain't got what I need, baby
That's why I hold you down, that's why I hold you down

I'll be done if I let this one get away (get away)
She's what I'm wanting (wanting), ain't no comparin' to you, girl (nah)
I'll never play with your heart, them silly games (nah)
No need for looking (uh-uh) 'cause there'll be none that hurt you, girl

Yeah, yo, listen, I ain't tryna play with you, I'm tryna stay with you
Y'ah mean? Spend forever and a day with you
Never mind them side chicks and they issues
They ain't nothing but bad luck that they wish you
It ain't about them knowing, it's 'bout the two of us
They can't stand to see us doing us
And I told you, this is what I go through
But words can't explain it so that's why now I gotta hold you

No girls'll ride like you do for me, baby (do for me)
That's why I hold you down, that's why I hold you down
Them girls on the side ain't got what I need, baby (ain't got what I need)
That's why I hold you down, that's why I hold you down (I got you, trust me)

You in good hands!
We gon' be aight
Haha, I luh you, mwah
