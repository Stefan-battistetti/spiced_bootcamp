After love
After love
After love

No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you

It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

Do you believe in life after love?
Do you believe in life after love?
Do you believe in life after love?
Do you believe in life after love?

What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you
Well, I can't do that
And there's no turning back

I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've got time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh

Do you believe in life after love?
Do you believe in life after love?
Do you believe in life after love?
Do you believe in life after love?

After love
After love
After love

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

And I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore

And I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore

And I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore
