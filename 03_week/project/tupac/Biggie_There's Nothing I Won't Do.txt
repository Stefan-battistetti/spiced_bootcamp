Spaceman
I always wanted you to go
Into Spaceman (Intergalactic Christ)
Spaceman
I always wanted you to go
Into Spaceman (Intergalactic Christ)

Pungent smells
They consummate my home
Beyond the black horizon
Trying to take control
See my girl
She shivers in her bones
The sun and zenith rising
Trying to take us all

There's a fire between us
So where is your god
There's a fire between us
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off this world

This sickening taste
Homophobic jokes
Images of fascist votes
Beam me up
Cause I can't breath

Spaceman
I always wanted you to go
Into Spaceman

It's time to terminate
The great wide world
Morbid fascinations
Television takes control
Decimation different races fall
Electronic information
Tampers with your soul

There's a fire between us
So where is your god
There's a fire between us
I can't get off the carousel
I fall off this world

This sickening taste
Homophobic jokes
Images of fascist votes
Beam me up
Cause I can't breath

Spaceman
I always wanted you to go
Into Spaceman (Intergalactic Christ)
Spaceman
I always wanted you to go
Into Spaceman (Intergalactic Christ)
