[Charlie Brown (Leaders of the New School)]
Just when ya
Just when ya
(Just when ya thought it was safe!)
KO, now let your homeboy in on the scoop (scoop)
Yo, but now your life is turning for a loop (a loop)
And things (and things) yo, aren't so great in paradise
Shit, your friend (friend) is kickin' it to your girl (girl. Girl? Girl!)
Left you (left you) leavin' you (leavin' you) and now you just contemplate suicide
(Just when you thought it was safe!)

[Busta Rhymes (Leaders of the New School)]
Man, to smoke that white rock jumbo (jumbo)
You should have known it was a no-no (no-no)
It's stunning (stunning)
But now you're living foul and slumming
You thought it was okay (okay)
To sex that girl without a condom (condom)
You know you had your sex pandemonium (monium)
But instead (instead) with AIDS you lay on your death bed
(Just when you thought it was safe!)

[Dinco D (Leaders of the New School)]
My man, to take that plane over seas (the seas)
And then the terrorist group the Killer Bees (the Bees)
Claims a bomb is on board your flight
And due to explode in the boom (B-B-B-Bang!)
Now you're on a mission to nowhere (nowhere)
Like an innocent victim, it's sad
Quite a shock, and really disturbing
(Just when you thought it was safe!)

[Charlie Brown]
Yo man, I heard you was with my girl behind my back man

[Busta Rhymes]
I wasn't with her G

(Just when you thought it was safe!)

[Busta Rhymes]
With your base pipe and your rock, now you're slummin', G

(Just when you thought it was safe!)

[Dinco D]
I'll pass on the Sandals and walk, you know what I'm sayin'

(Just when you thought it was safe
To live, safe to trust
But then again
It really wasn't!)

[Busta Rhymes (Leaders of the New School)]
Safe is the way of the mind (the mind)
To avoid trouble, risk you may find (may find)
All those (all thouse) we may (we may) huh, live in a trifling time

[Charlie Brown (Leaders of the New School)]
Yo, yo but then again (again)
Think of the whole equation (what?)
If life and death are negative (or a positive)
Judged by the actions of your soul

[Dinco D (Leaders of the New School)]
I said time after time after time (time)
Things may fall out of line (outa line)
So consider (consider) my whole agenda (agenda)
The Leaders have seen a new sign of peace (peace)
Equality (equality)
Busta Rhymes: Amongs man, woman and child
Charlie Brown: Yo be safe and secure (righteous and pure)
Cause now is when times gets wild

(Just when you thought it was safe!) [Repeat: x4]
