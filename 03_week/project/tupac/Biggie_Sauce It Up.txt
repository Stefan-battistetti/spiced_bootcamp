[Ice Cube]
Yo Jinx man, we gotta find somebody that's down for hers, man
All these girls simple man, who you think fit the category?

[Yo-Yo]
Its me, the brand new intelligent black woman why-O-why-O
Which is Yo-Yo, but I'm not to be played
Like I was made by matell
But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male
I rhyme about uprights upliftin the woman
For that are superior to handle by any male
Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show
And if you ask my producers that we fly and you know

(Chorus: repeat 2x, Ice Cube)
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
"Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out"

[Verse 1]
My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho
I like to flow so swift, its got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift, as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who came to dap
To the fact I get the 8-ball, or the jam
The earrings I wear are called dophins
Check the booty, yo its kinda soft and
If you touch, you livin in a coffin(word to mother)
I'm in the 90s, your still in the 80s right
I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady like
But I'ma lady, who will pull a stunt though
I kill suckas, and even hit the block
So what you want to do?
Ya must play it wrong(ay yo)
Cause to me, you simply can't get none
You wetter, then a hotter ho in snow
Tell em Ice Cube, 
(Ice Cube)
No, you can't play with my Yo-Yo
Suckas

(Chorus: 2x)
(Ice Cube)
what's yo name baby?

[Verse 2]
that's right, my name is Yo-Yo, but know I'm not a dunkin
As I rap, chilly chill bringin the funk and
I steal yo man, as if he was a hawk and
He'll call me baby, yo, or even pumpkin
I may be buttercup, or even Ms.Yo
We had dinner, and know we drinkin Cisco
Hit the slow jams, its gettin cosy
Your home alone, so now you gettin nosy
Your kinda young, so of course you had to call replace
Hang up in my face, its a sad case
So who ya man dippin the dollars, what
Yup, for puttin lipstick on his collar
At home, he's gotta listen to ya holla
But he'll slap ya, and sock ya, so why bother?
But if you come knockin at my do'(ay yo)
I'll smoke you, tell em Ice
(Ice Cube)
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, sucka

(Chorus: 2x)
(Ice Cube)
Fool, 1990 and stand sucka free, yeah
Tell em what's up

*Yo-Yo Rhyming Over Females Voice As She Did Earlier In The Song*
Yo, I hope you realize one day
That ya week is Monday threw Sunday
So listen to my why-O, here's my bio
And next to me, ha, your not fly yo
Ya lack skills to be a woman that's black
Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts
Yo-Yo, is just tryna to stop ya
Because the world ain't a big soap opera
It only takes one punch to drop ya
And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya
But no, I'm not livin like that first
Although I pack, a real small gat in my purse(right, right)
But no, its not to cause corruptions
Just to fight back on the structions
Just thought you want to know about the why-O-why-O
Yo, should I tell em Ice
(Ice Cube)
They know what time it is

(Chorus: 2x)
(Ice Cube)
Yo-Yo, the brand new intelligent black lady
Stompin to the 90s!
For all why'all suckas
Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it
You Can't play wit my Yo-Yo

[Verse 3]
The simple to a methaphor, make someone to yell on
To keep it at a latest while they're yellin, "more, more!"
I am very versatile, changin my ways to different styles
Knowledge is the key, expense is for my backround
Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel imperior
Follow me on the hands of time, makes no man superior
Should we jam and take the stand, and disback all the
Men who know no more the slang, slang
And thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think its time that we defeat
And stand on our on two feet
If we want to live wit justice and harmony
How many more rounds must I go
In order to let my people know
Times were hard, things have changed
"Don't try to play me out"

{*female singing*}
Ladyyyyyyyy("don't try to play me out")
Yayyyy, yay hey("don't try to play me out)
Yay, yay, yay, yay
