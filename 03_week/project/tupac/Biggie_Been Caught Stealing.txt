Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday, yeah
Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday

Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
Well, don't, ah no, hesitate
'Cause your love just won't wait, yeah

Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday, yeah
I wanna tell you I love your way, everyday, yeah
I wanna be with you night and day

The moon appears to shine and light the skies
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine
I can see them under the pine
But don't, no, no, hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait

Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday, yeah
I wanna tell you I love your way, everyday, yeah
I wanna be with you night and day, oh baby, oh baby, please, everyday

I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and grey, and blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one out of season
But don't, no, no, no, hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, just won't wait

Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday
I wanna tell you I love your way (I wanna tell you I love your way)
I wanna be with you night and day (everyday and every way)

Ooh, baby, I love your way
I wanna tell you I love your way
I wanna be with you night and day
Ooh, baby, I love your way
