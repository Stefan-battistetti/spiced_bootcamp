Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust, label us notorious
Thug ass niggaz that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggaz be scramblin', gamblin'

Up in restaurants with mandolins, and violins
We just sittin' here tryin' to win, tryin' not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily countin' them Benjamins

Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since ninety-two
Look at all the bullshit I been through

So-called beef with you know who
F*ck a few female stars or two
Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like mike, shit
Not to be fucked with

Motherfucker better duck quick, 'cause
Me and my dogs love to buck shit
F*ck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game

Spit yo' game, talk yo' shit
Grab yo' gat, call yo' clique
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one

All them niggaz I got to fight one
All them hoes I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
Whatcha gonna do, fight or run?

Seems to me that you'll take b
Bone and big, nigga die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rule everything around me

Shit, lyrically, niggas can't see me
F*ck it, buy the coke
Cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it

Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the mo thugs dudes
Who's the killa, me or you?

(We forgive you, for you know not what you do)

Seven A.M. Woke in the mornin'
With henny and caffeine and green and nicotine
No dough so pop a couple of doze
Lil ripsta, nigga mista clean

Nigga dean, deep in my temple and not to get
Sentimentally sting, wit' my
Instrumelody, and heated
Especially for your team

And a forty-five indeed will beam
In between the scenes destroy your dreams
You willin' to die, we'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene

We mean mug, mo thugs
Trained to be perfect, disciples
When it's survival tongue, never double-edged sword

Triple, six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch
Breakin' out for lies
My messiahs better be ready for Armageddon shit's expired

It's wild, bless the child
The one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Claire
All that I had to do was stare

Test me now, contender never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand
One of my trusted friend friend, hey
Open it let's see if we're real, we all suited

Beg my pardon to martin
Baby we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin' there's a tough law
Every day in the ghetto

We start 'em off little we give 'em a bottle
And a pen and a pad to hit the label kick it

Nigga roll wit Bone up into the thug spot
To the dome wit' a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge

But I'm broke as f*ck son gimme that mossberg swerve
Up into my bag, 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this twelve gauge sawed off
Get em all off, nigga yo' loss, take it all off

Got a nigga car door
But the Bone not leatherface, too many are thinkin' they thugs
They need the most help to pull it in doves
And bitch if you stickin' we buckin' them guzzlers, fucked up

Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind

Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But willie be servin' 'em clemency
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talkin'
Like gimme back me money

Thuggin with me killers, need us a leader
Or liquor but niggaz ain't got shit
Wit a sawed off pump chrome thirty-eight pistol
Now who ready to get bent

Nigga like me feenin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money so
I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke

Get high, get high, get high

Yeah, little lay hey comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya wit magic
Droppin' down licks betta call on my gadgets
With an automatics status we spray time to load the glocks

But I'm thinkin' not
There's another he forced tellin' me do what I gotta do
So my otha potnah nigga die tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue

Biggie booms on my ass now provide the cellular phone
The carphone, what's happenin'
Grab artillery niggaz start packin'
'Cause a motherfucker try to get me in a jacket, and I did him

Hit him right between the eyes, despise the wise
Wanna test a nigga size, that'll cost him
Nigga f*ck around wit the wrong shit
Y'all get mo murdered all day, all day

We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggaz wanna have a little fun wit number one
One, one, then it red red rum rum rum rum rum rum
But it red red rum rum rum rum rum rum
But it red red rum
