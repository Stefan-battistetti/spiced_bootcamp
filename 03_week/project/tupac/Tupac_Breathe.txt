Breathe
The hand that holds, the heart that holds me down
Breathe
The feeling that we had is nowhere now
Breathe
And hope that someday it comes back around
Breathe
I need to be received by something

Breathe
And I almost lost my mind
And I almost lost my mind
And I almost lost my mind
And I almost lost my mind
And I almost lost my mind

Breathe
The hand that holds, the heart that holds me down
Breathe
The feeling that we had is nowhere now

Breathe
And I almost lost my mind
And I almost lost my mind
And I almost lost my mind
And I almost lost my mind
And I almost lost my mind
