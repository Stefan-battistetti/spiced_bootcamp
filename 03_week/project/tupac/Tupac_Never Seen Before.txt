Peace to Chuck
Chuck D
Yeah, uhh
You're not telling 'em huh? Yeah

[Erick Sermon]
They go oh and when I jump in my car
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
When I'm supreme rap star, they all know me
E.D., when I flash the greens on TV
MC's be robbing me, of my technique
The way I speak, the way I get down, the way I sound
And if you axe/ask me, they must be on the jock
Of the innovator (one two), rock roll bounce to skater

[Parrish Smith]
OK f*ck it, enough with the tight shit, grab the mic quick
Hollywood niggas, put it down spit some hype shit
EPMD Erick and Parrish, Making Dollars
With the rap scholars keep the show packed like funeral parlors
Deadly, murderous I know you heard of us
Holding shit down on the block, nobody serving us (yeah son)
The E Double and Mic Doc, Boondox
Def Jam's off the meter yo, this shit is hot

[Chorus: x2]
Never seen before, or heard before
The uncut raw
I'm Erick Sermon
And I'm Parrish Smith

[Erick Sermon]
Check it, now I'm back with the fliest material
Mic Doc and E Dub the Grand Imperial
My mic's deadly, so I scratched off the serial
And stashed it, until I have to kill at will
Keep it moving, yes it's me in the flesh
It's no illusion, f*ck around and catch minor contusions
Whatever, I'm Smoking Joe when it comes to rap
I'm a pro-fessional, Tiger Woods I'm good

[Parrish Smith]
Time to black out, no doubt, people wanna know about
The inside scoop with the group, and are they comin out
Damn skippy I'm tipsy, high like a hippie
Don't take drinks from strangers cause niggaz slip mickies
That's why I stay on Q/cue, like Omar Epps in J-U
I-C-E so chill and bust the debut
In rare form the false alarm's the Mic Don's
Back in effect, snap that neck, the P's gone

[Chorus]

Never say never
What? EPMD's back together
And if it gets warm take off the hot sweater
Flip the ill slick flow (flow)
Watch us throw (throw)
Down with the other brothers toe to toe
And if ya slow ya blow
That's why we coming with the ammo
Yo ten year veterans
A thousand rap sessions
Yeah the hard rockers
The crowd shockers
The head knockers
Yeah EPMD's off the rockers

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, uh, uh, uh-huh, yeah
Dude whats up
Yeah that was dope, word
