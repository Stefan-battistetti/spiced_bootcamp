I know your tired of bouncin' so check this here
We got tha back breakin' club shakin' beat for this year
Yeah, so peep the steelo and the flow
I gotcha head noddin' 'cause your neck already knows
So pass the mic and watch Skillz rip fast
And have niggas up in parties catchin' whiplash
Slash the wack, who tryin to bite my style
Take yo ass to da old school
And part your fuckin' eyebrows
I comin' through to
About to get set
So act like WU
Protect that Neck
I still calm, I'm still tendin' to the song
I be blowin' up spots like I was sendin' out mailbombs
Stya calm and be noddin' see
I'm like a black president (why)
'Cause niggas ain't seein' me
Has beens they both like bad skinz so face it
After this joint yo we passin' out some neck braces

My track packs energy like nuclear reactors
I be Mad Skillz and this be the Nod Factor
After Mc's smoke me take a toke
I'll f*ck your career like the cast on different Strokes
No joke..I see airlines and start aimin' rhymes
My shit will have hard niggas in soul train lines
Bumpin' wit' this big black broad named Belinda
Oh you rap don't say jack 
And walk quiet like a ninja
I injure, beats so you can expect to go to Cairo
So I can practice checkin' that neck and got set
'Cause guess what I'm the one to set it
You regret it
'Cause my beats employin' paramedics
I wet it
Yeah and it will stay that way
I know you'll be back
You probably got some rhymes on lay away
But I be here freakin' fat funk to make you sweat
Do me a favor
And tell your neck that I ain't finished yet

I perfect raps stick in under your skin
Either your noddin' by now
Or your dead or a mannequin
My friend resistin' ain't good for ya health
Put your tool on the shelf
And just go for self
Get help..get da drink and get the hidin'
Get your groove on
Before he get gis glock and gat up the party like Gotti
I'm runnin' thangs from the inside
Rap better wait because your style done died
And let you corny-spiderman Mc's sayin' nothin'
Put your clothes on backwards if you feel like frontin'
I'm huntin' for beats/on point like cleets
Wit da brand new sound
You can pump in ya jeeps
It be the Nod Factor
Rollin' hard like tecs
I'm Skillz for real
Bringin' it to you somethin' stank
This track will be in ya ear
Like new wax/now max
And tell your neck veins to relax
